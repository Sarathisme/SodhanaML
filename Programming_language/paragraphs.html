The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any <a href="/wiki/Decidability_(logic)" title="Decidability (logic)">decidable</a> type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have <i>type loopholes</i>, usually unchecked <a href="/wiki/Type_conversion#Explicit_type_conversion" title="Type conversion">casts</a> that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Type_checking" title="Type checking">type check</a> programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, <a href="/wiki/Type_inference" title="Type inference">infer types</a>, relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as <i><a href="/wiki/Type_theory" title="Type theory">type theory</a></i>.\n</p>, <p>A language is <i>typed</i> if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable, with the implication that it is not applicable to other types.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-typing_47-0"><a href="#cite_note-typing-47">[47]</a></sup> For example, the data represented by <code>"this text between the quotes"</code> is a <a href="/wiki/String_literal" title="String literal">string</a>, and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will be rejected by the compilers. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected when the program is run ("dynamic" type checking), resulting in a run-time <a href="/wiki/Exception_handling" title="Exception handling">exception</a>.

In JavaScript, for example, the expression <code>2 * x</code> implicitly converts <code>x</code> to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, an <code>Array</code>, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.\n<i>Strong</i> and <i>static</i> are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term <i>strongly typed</i> to mean <i>strongly, statically typed</i>, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply <i>statically typed</i>. Thus <a href="/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a> has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>It may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be "weakly, statically typed". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the <b>void*</b> pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as <code>(int)</code> or <code>(char)</code>.\n</p>, <p>Most programming languages have an associated core <a href="/wiki/Library_(computing)" title="Library (computing)">library</a> (sometimes known as the \'standard library\', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.\n</p>, <p>The line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language\'s core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>, a string literal is defined as an instance of the <code>java.lang.String</code> class; similarly, in <a href="/wiki/Smalltalk" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Anonymous_function" title="Anonymous function">anonymous function</a> expression (a "block") constructs an instance of the library\'s <code>BlockContext</code> class. Conversely, <a href="/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)" title="Scheme (programming language)">Scheme</a> contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.\n</p>, <p>Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing <i>language families</i> of related languages branching one from another.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Fischer_51-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fischer-51">[51]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-levenez_52-0"><a href="#cite_note-levenez-52">[52]</a></sup> But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage.

When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program\'s inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program.
