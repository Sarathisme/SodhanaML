From its origins in <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" title="Cybernetics">cybernetics</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence" title="History of artificial intelligence">Dartmouth Conference</a> (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as <a href="/wiki/Applied_mathematics" title="Applied mathematics">applied mathematics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_logic" title="Mathematical logic">symbolic logic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Semiotics" title="Semiotics">semiotics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind" title="Philosophy of mind">philosophy of mind</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neurophysiology" title="Neurophysiology">neurophysiology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Social_intelligence" title="Social intelligence">social intelligence</a>.
