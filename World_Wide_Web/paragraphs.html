In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced <a href="/wiki/ENQUIRE" title="ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the <a href="/wiki/Network_address" title="Network address">network address</a> of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word <i><a href="/wiki/Hypertext" title="Hypertext">hypertext</a></i>, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term <i><a href="/wiki/Hypermedia" title="Hypermedia">hypermedia</a></i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast <a href="/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" title="Robert Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" (one word) as a "web" of "hypertext documents" to be viewed by "<a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">browsers</a>" using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_architecture" title="Client\xe2\x80\x93server architecture">client\xe2\x80\x93server architecture</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-W90_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-W90-11">[11]</a></sup> At this point HTML and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test.

In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n</p>, <p>The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of <i><a href="/wiki/Link_rot" title="Link rot">link rot</a></i>. Unlike predecessors such as <a href="/wiki/HyperCard" title="HyperCard">HyperCard</a>, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the <a href="/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)" title="Gopher (protocol)">Gopher</a> protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was <a href="/wiki/ViolaWWW" title="ViolaWWW">ViolaWWW</a> for <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/X_Windowing_System" title="X Windowing System">X Windowing System</a>.\n</p>, <p>Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> of the <a href="/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)" title="Mosaic (web browser)">Mosaic</a> web browser<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the <a href="/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications" title="National Center for Supercomputing Applications">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign" title="University of Illinois at Urbana\xe2\x80\x93Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana\xe2\x80\x93Champaign</a> (NCSA-UIUC), led by <a href="/wiki/Marc_Andreessen" title="Marc Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a>.

Mosaic\'s graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" title="World Wide Web Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency" title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/INRIA" title="INRIA">INRIA</a> (a French national computer research lab) with support from the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at <a href="/wiki/Keio_University" title="Keio University">Keio University</a>. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many <a href="/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995" title="List of websites founded before 1995">notable websites</a> were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today\'s most popular services.\n</p>, <p>Connected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the <a href="/wiki/Markup_language" title="Markup language">markup languages</a> to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a <a href="/wiki/Semantic_Web" title="Semantic Web">Semantic Web</a>. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Although the two terms are sometimes <a href="/wiki/Conflation" title="Conflation">conflated</a> in popular use, <i>World Wide Web</i> is not <a href="/wiki/Synonym" title="Synonym">synonymous</a> with <i>Internet</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> The Web is an <a href="/wiki/Information_space" title="Information space">information space</a> containing hyperlinked documents and other <a href="/wiki/Web_resource" title="Web resource">resources</a>, identified by their URIs.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> It is implemented as  both client and server software using Internet protocols such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TCP/IP" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>. Berners-Lee was <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">knighted</a> in 2004 by Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II" title="Elizabeth II">Elizabeth II</a> for "services to the global development of the Internet".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-gaz_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-gaz-32">[32]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The terms <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i> are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">computer networks</a>. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other <a href="/wiki/Web_resource" title="Web resource">resources</a>, linked by hyperlinks and <a href="/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URIs</a>. Web resources are accessed using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> or <a href="/wiki/HTTPS" title="HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet\'s transport protocols.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Viewing a <a href="/wiki/Web_page" title="Web page">web page</a> on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator" title="Uniform resource locator">URL</a> of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\xe2\x80\x94and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\xe2\x80\x94came to be known as \'browsing,\' \'web surfing\' (after <a href="/wiki/Channel_surfing" title="Channel surfing">channel surfing</a>), or \'navigating the Web\'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code>http://www.example.org/home.html</code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">Internet Protocol address</a> using the globally distributed <a href="/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as <i>203.0.113.4</i> or <i>2001:db8:2e::7334</i>. The browser then requests the resource by sending an <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</a> request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses <a href="/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" title="List of TCP and UDP port numbers">port number 80</a>. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n</p>, <p>The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n</p>, <p>followed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language (<a href="/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a>) for a basic web page might look like this:\n</p>, <p>The web browser <a href="/wiki/Parsing" title="Parsing">parses</a> the HTML and interprets the markup (<code class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code>, <code class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Client-side_scripting" title="Client-side scripting">scripts</a> that affect page behaviour, and <a href="/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="Cascading Style Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_media_type" title="Internet media type">Internet media types</a>. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively <a href="/wiki/Browser_engine" title="Browser engine">renders</a> the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n</p>, <p>Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<code class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"http://www.example.org/home.html"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Example.org Homepage<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code>\n</p>, <p>Such a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a <i>web</i> of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the <i>WorldWideWeb</i> (in its original <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CamelCase" title="CamelCase">CamelCase</a>, which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-W90_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-W90-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the <a href="/wiki/Webgraph" title="Webgraph">webgraph</a>: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dead_link" title="Dead link">dead links</a>.

Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as <i>www2</i>, <i>secure</i> or <i>en</i> for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the <i>www</i> subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites.
