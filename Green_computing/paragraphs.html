Negative power usage effectiveness, makes use of extreme differences between temperatures at times running the computing facilities, that they would run only from external sources other than the power use for computing. \n</p>, <p>The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs.  Algorithm changes, such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero.  In 2009, a study by a physicist at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harvard" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> estimated that the average Google search released 7 grams of carbon dioxide (CO\xe2\x82\x82).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> However, Google disputed this figure, arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2 grams of CO\xe2\x82\x82.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive. Researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs. The researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed. However, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; it reduces only the cost to the company using it. Nonetheless, a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way. A similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather; this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available.

The concept originated with the IBM <a href="/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computer">mainframe</a> operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/X86_architecture" title="X86 architecture">x86</a>-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby conserving resources by removing need for the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Intel_Corporation" title="Intel Corporation">Intel Corporation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices" title="Advanced Micro Devices">AMD</a> have also built proprietary <a href="/wiki/X86_virtualization#Hardware_support" title="X86 virtualization">virtualization enhancements</a> to the x86 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instruction_set" title="Instruction set">instruction set</a> into each of their CPU product lines, in order to facilitate virtual computing.\n</p>, <p>New virtual technologies, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Linux_Containers" title="Linux Containers">Linux Containers</a> can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a more efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machines</a>, so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Terminal servers have also been used in green computing.
