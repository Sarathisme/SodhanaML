[<p><b>Image compression</b> is a type of <a href="/wiki/Data_compression" title="Data compression">data compression</a> applied to <a href="/wiki/Digital_image" title="Digital image">digital images</a>, to reduce their cost for <a href="/wiki/Computer_data_storage" title="Computer data storage">storage</a> or <a href="/wiki/Data_transmission" title="Data transmission">transmission</a>. <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">Algorithms</a> may take advantage of <a href="/wiki/Visual_perception" title="Visual perception">visual perception</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statistical" title="Statistical">statistical</a> properties of image data to provide superior results compared with generic compression methods.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Image compression may be <a href="/wiki/Lossy_compression" title="Lossy compression">lossy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Lossless_compression" title="Lossless compression">lossless</a>.  Lossless compression is preferred for archival purposes and often for medical imaging, technical drawings, <a href="/wiki/Clip_art" title="Clip art">clip art</a>, or comics. Lossy compression methods, especially when used at low <a href="/wiki/Bit_rate" title="Bit rate">bit rates</a>, introduce <a href="/wiki/Compression_artifact" title="Compression artifact">compression artifacts</a>.  Lossy methods are especially suitable for natural images such as photographs in applications where minor (sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial reduction in bit rate. Lossy compression that produces negligible differences may be called visually lossless.\n</p>, <p>Methods for lossless image compression are:\n</p>, <p>Methods for lossy compression:\n</p>, <p>The best image quality at a given compression rate (or <a href="/wiki/Bit_rate" title="Bit rate">bit rate</a>) is the main goal of image compression, however, there are other important properties of image compression schemes:\n</p>, <p><b>Scalability</b> generally refers to a quality reduction achieved by manipulation of the bitstream or file (without decompression and re-compression). Other names for scalability are <i>progressive coding</i> or <i>embedded bitstreams</i>. Despite its contrary nature, scalability also may be found in lossless codecs, usually in form of coarse-to-fine pixel scans. Scalability is especially useful for previewing images while downloading them (e.g., in a web browser) or for providing variable quality access to e.g., databases. There are several types of scalability:\n</p>, <p><b>Region of interest coding</b>. Certain parts of the image are encoded with higher quality than others. This may be combined with scalability (encode these parts first, others later).\n</p>, <p><b>Meta information</b>. Compressed data may contain information about the image which may be used to categorize, search, or browse images. Such information may include color and texture statistics, small <a href="/wiki/Preview_(computing)" title="Preview (computing)">preview</a> images, and author or copyright information.\n</p>, <p><b>Processing power</b>. Compression algorithms require different amounts of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Processing_power" title="Processing power">processing power</a> to encode and decode. Some high compression algorithms require high processing power.\n</p>, <p>The quality of a compression method often is measured by the <a href="/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio" title="Peak signal-to-noise ratio">peak signal-to-noise ratio</a>. It measures the amount of noise introduced through a lossy compression of the image, however, the subjective judgment of the viewer also is regarded as an important measure, perhaps, being the most important measure.\n</p>]
