Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls.

Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response and policy/change management.

It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender\'s private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit (<a href="/wiki/Data_integrity" title="Data integrity">data integrity</a>). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity.

The analysis of these phenomena, which are characterized by breakdowns, surprises and side-effects, requires a theoretical approach that is able to examine and interpret subjectively the detail of each incident.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the loss of the asset).

This happens when employees\' job duties change, employees are promoted to a new position, or employees are transferred to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges, which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.\n</p>, <p>Physical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities and include doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security guards, cable locks, etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.\n</p>, <p>An important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the <a href="/wiki/System_administrator" title="System administrator">server administrator</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Database_administrator" title="Database administrator">database administrator</a>; these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Information security must protect information throughout its lifespan, from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information.  The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms. The building up, layering on and overlapping of security measures is called "defense in depth." In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense in depth strategy aims at a structure where, should one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-VaccaComputer13_49-0"><a href="#cite_note-VaccaComputer13-49">[49]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Recall the earlier discussion about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The three types of controls can be used to form the basis upon which to build a defense in depth strategy. With this approach, defense in depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid one on top of the other. Additional insight into defense in depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and <a href="/wiki/Network_security" title="Network security">network security</a>, host-based security and <a href="/wiki/Application_security" title="Application security">application security</a> forming the outermost layers of the onion. Both perspectives are equally valid, and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense in depth strategy.\n</p>, <p>An important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a <a href="/wiki/Classified_information" title="Classified information">security classification</a>. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required <a href="/wiki/Security_controls" title="Security controls">security controls</a> for each classification.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-BayukEnterprise09_50-0"><a href="#cite_note-BayukEnterprise09-50">[50]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information. The <a href="/wiki/ISACA" title="ISACA">Information Systems Audit and Control Association</a> (ISACA) and its <i>Business Model for Information Security</i> also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically, allowing actual risks to be addressed.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ISACA-BMIS_51-0"><a href="#cite_note-ISACA-BMIS-51">[51]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization, with examples being:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-BayukEnterprise09_50-1"><a href="#cite_note-BayukEnterprise09-50">[50]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>All employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification. The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.\n</p>, <p>Access to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information. The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">authentication</a>.\n</p>, <p>Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">authentication</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Authorization" title="Authorization">authorization</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-AndressTheBasics14_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-AndressTheBasics14-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement "Hello, my name is <a href="/wiki/John_Doe" title="John Doe">John Doe</a>" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming "I am the person the username belongs to".\n</p>, <p>Authentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the <a href="/wiki/Bank_teller" title="Bank teller">bank teller</a> he is John Doe, a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photo ID, so he hands the teller his <a href="/wiki/Driver%27s_license" title="Driver's license">driver\'s license</a>. The bank teller checks the license to make sure it has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.\n</p>, <p>There are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:\n</p>, <p>Strong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Username" title="Username">username</a> is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-52"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm" title="Time-based One-time Password Algorithm">Time-based One-time Password algorithms</a>.\n</p>, <p>After a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called <a href="/wiki/Authorization" title="Authorization">authorization</a>. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-AndressTheBasics14_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-AndressTheBasics14-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration. The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources. In the mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource.\n</p>, <p>Examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Role-Based_Access_Control" title="Role-Based Access Control">role-based access control</a>, available in many advanced database management systems; simple <a href="/wiki/File_system_permissions" title="File system permissions">file permissions</a> provided in the UNIX and Windows operating systems; <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Group_Policy_Object" title="Group Policy Object">Group Policy Objects</a> provided in Windows network systems; and <a href="/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)" title="Kerberos (protocol)">Kerberos</a>, <a href="/wiki/RADIUS" title="RADIUS">RADIUS</a>, <a href="/wiki/TACACS" title="TACACS">TACACS</a>, and the simple access lists used in many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Firewall_(networking)" title="Firewall (networking)">firewalls</a> and <a href="/wiki/Router_(computing)" title="Router (computing)">routers</a>.\n</p>, <p>To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="United States Department of the Treasury">U.S. Treasury</a>\'s guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of <a href="/wiki/Audit_trail" title="Audit trail">audit trail</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-53"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Also, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a <a href="/wiki/Classified_information" title="Classified information">top-secret clearance</a>, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privileges to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.\n</p>, <p>Information security uses <a href="/wiki/Cryptography" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a> to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a>. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the <a href="/wiki/Key_(cryptography)" title="Key (cryptography)">cryptographic key</a>, through the process of decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the <a href="/wiki/Information" title="Information">information</a> is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-AndressTheBasics14_2-4"><a href="#cite_note-AndressTheBasics14-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, <a href="/wiki/Non-repudiation" title="Non-repudiation">non-repudiation</a>, and encrypted network communications. Older, less secure applications such as <a href="/wiki/Telnet" title="Telnet">Telnet</a> and <a href="/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" title="File Transfer Protocol">File Transfer Protocol</a> (FTP) are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as <a href="/wiki/Secure_Shell" title="Secure Shell">Secure Shell</a> (SSH) that use encrypted network communications. Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as <a href="/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access" title="Wi-Fi Protected Access">WPA/WPA2</a> or the older (and less secure) <a href="/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy">WEP</a>. Wired communications (such as <a href="/wiki/ITU-T" title="ITU-T">ITU\xe2\x80\x91T</a> <a href="/wiki/G.hn" title="G.hn">G.hn</a>) are secured using <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</a> for encryption and <a href="/wiki/X.1035" title="X.1035">X.1035</a> for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GnuPG" title="GnuPG">GnuPG</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</a> can be used to encrypt data files and email.\n</p>, <p>Cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The <a href="/wiki/Key_size" title="Key size">length and strength</a> of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is <a href="/wiki/Weak_key" title="Weak key">weak</a> or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed. <a href="/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure" title="Public key infrastructure">Public key infrastructure</a> (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround <a href="/wiki/Key_management" title="Key management">key management</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-AndressTheBasics14_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-AndressTheBasics14-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The terms "reasonable and prudent person," "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Due_care" title="Due care">due care</a>" and "due diligence" have been used in the fields of finance, securities, and law for many years.

This is often described as the "reasonable and prudent person" rule. A prudent person takes due care to ensure that everything necessary is done to operate the business by sound business principles and in a legal ethical manner. A prudent person is also diligent (mindful, attentive, and ongoing) in their due care of the business.\n</p>, <p>In the field of information security, Harris<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>\noffers the following definitions of due care and due diligence:\n</p>, <p><i>"Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company, its resources, and employees."</i> And, [Due diligence are the] <i>"continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational."</i>\n</p>, <p>Attention should be made to two important points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.\n</p>, <p>Organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security. The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-56"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> provides principles and practices for evaluating risk. It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA helps evaluate safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden.

This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers and software. The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made. It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-CampbellPractical16_58-0"><a href="#cite_note-CampbellPractical16-58">[58]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk. Even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects. One of management\'s many responsibilities is the management of risk. Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment. Part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented.\n</p>, <p>Not every change needs to be managed. Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment. Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management. However, relocating user file shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity. The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.\n</p>, <p>Change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas, security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application developers, desktop support and the help desk. The tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application. The responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization\'s documented change management procedures are followed.
