Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A prototypical example of an algorithm is the <a href="/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm" title="Euclidean algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a> to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the <a href="/wiki/Flowchart" title="Flowchart">flowchart</a> above and as an example in a later section.\n</p>, <p><a href="#CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999">Boolos, Jeffrey &amp; 1974, 1999</a> offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:\n</p>, <p>No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough\xe2\x80\xa0 ( \xe2\x80\xa0"smaller and smaller without limit ...you\'d be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give <i>explicit instructions for determining the <b>n</b>th member of the set</i>, for arbitrary finite <i>n</i>. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which <i>they could be followed by a computing machine</i>, or by a <i>human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.</i><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></p>, <p>An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an <i>arbitrary</i> "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as <i>y = m + n</i> \xe2\x80\x93 two arbitrary "input variables" <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> that produce an output <i>y</i>.

In <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a>, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of <i>algorithm</i> that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.\n</p>, <p>Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees\' paychecks or printing students\' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a <a href="/wiki/Turing_reduction" title="Turing reduction">Turing-complete</a> system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):\n</p>, <p> Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine.

Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if <i>negative</i> numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domain_(mathematics)" title="Domain (mathematics)">domain</a> of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that <a href="/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)" title="Instance (computer science)">instantiates</a> it) is a <a href="/wiki/Partial_function" title="Partial function">partial function</a> rather than a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Total_function" title="Total function">total function</a>.

Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.\n</p>, <p>The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.\n</p>, <p>It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the <a href="/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms" title="Analysis of algorithms">analysis of algorithms</a> to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(<i>n</i>), using the <a href="/wiki/Big_O_notation" title="Big O notation">big O notation</a> with <i>n</i> as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of <i>O(1)</i>, if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(<i>n</i>) if it is counted.\n</p>, <p>Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or \'<a href="/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency" title="Algorithmic efficiency">effort</a>\' than others.

However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their <a href="/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency" title="Algorithmic efficiency">algorithmic efficiency</a> is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical.
