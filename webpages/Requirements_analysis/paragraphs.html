[<p>In <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">systems engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering" title="Software engineering">software engineering</a>, <b>requirements analysis</b> encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting <a href="/wiki/Requirement" title="Requirement">requirements</a> of the various <a href="/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)" title="Stakeholder (corporate)">stakeholders</a>, <i>analyzing, documenting, validating and managing</i> software or system requirements.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Requirements analysis is critical to the success or failure of a systems or software project.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.\n</p>, <p>Conceptually, requirements analysis includes three types of activities:<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>\n</p>, <p>Requirements analysis can be a long and tiring process during which many delicate psychological skills are involved. Large systems may confront analysts with hundreds or thousands of system requirements.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-bec1_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-bec1-4">[4]</a></sup> New systems change the environment and relationships between people, so it is important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs and ensure they understand the implications of the new systems. Analysts can employ several techniques to elicit the requirements from the customer. These may include the development of scenarios (represented as <a href="/wiki/User_story" title="User story">user stories</a> in <a href="/wiki/Agile_software_development" title="Agile software development">agile methods</a>), the identification of <a href="/wiki/Use_case" title="Use case">use cases</a>, the use of workplace observation or <a href="/wiki/Ethnography" title="Ethnography">ethnography</a>,  holding <a href="/wiki/Interview" title="Interview">interviews</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Focus_group" title="Focus group">focus groups</a> (more aptly named in this context as requirements workshops, or requirements review sessions) and creating requirements lists. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prototyping" title="Prototyping">Prototyping</a> may be used to develop an example system that can be demonstrated to stakeholders.  Where necessary, the analyst will employ a combination of these methods to establish the exact requirements of the stakeholders, so that a system that meets the business needs is produced.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>  Requirements quality can be improved through these and other methods\n</p>, <p>See <a href="/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis" title="Stakeholder analysis">Stakeholder analysis</a> for a discussion of people or organizations (legal entities such as companies, standards bodies) that have a valid interest in the system. They may be affected by it either directly or indirectly.\nA major new emphasis in the 1990s was a focus on the identification of <i>stakeholders</i>. It is increasingly recognized that stakeholders are not limited to the organization employing the analyst. Other stakeholders will include:\n</p>, <p>Requirements often have cross-functional implications that are unknown to individual stakeholders and often missed or incompletely defined during stakeholder interviews. These cross-functional implications can be elicited by conducting JRD sessions in a controlled environment, facilitated by a trained <a href="/wiki/Facilitator" title="Facilitator">facilitator</a> (Business Analyst), wherein stakeholders participate in discussions to elicit requirements, analyze their details and uncover cross-functional implications. A dedicated scribe should be present to document the discussion, freeing up the Business Analyst to lead the discussion in a direction that generates appropriate requirements which meet the session objective.\n</p>, <p>JRD Sessions are analogous to <a href="/wiki/Joint_application_design" title="Joint application design">Joint Application Design</a> Sessions. In the former, the sessions elicit requirements that guide design, whereas the latter elicit the specific design features to be implemented in satisfaction of elicited requirements.\n</p>, <p>One traditional way of documenting requirements has been contract style requirement lists. In a complex system such requirements lists can run to hundreds of pages long.\n</p>, <p>An appropriate metaphor would be an extremely long shopping list. Such lists are very much out of favour in modern analysis; as they have proved spectacularly unsuccessful at achieving their aims; but they are still seen to this day.\n</p>, <p>As an alternative to requirement lists, <a href="/wiki/Agile_software_development" title="Agile software development">Agile Software Development</a> uses <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/User_stories" title="User stories">User stories</a> to suggest requirements in everyday language.\n</p>, <p>Best practices take the composed list of requirements merely as clues and repeatedly ask "why?" until the actual business purposes are discovered. Stakeholders and developers can then devise tests to measure what level of each goal has been achieved thus far.  Such goals change more slowly than the long list of specific but unmeasured requirements. Once a small set of critical, measured goals has been established, <a href="/wiki/Software_prototyping#Throwaway_prototyping" title="Software prototyping">rapid prototyping</a> and short iterative development phases may proceed to deliver actual stakeholder value long before the project is half over.\n</p>, <p>A prototype is a computer program that exhibits a part of the properties of another computer program, allowing users to visualize an application that has not yet been constructed. A popular form of prototype is a <a href="/wiki/Mockup" title="Mockup">mockup</a>, which helps future users and other stakeholders to get an idea of what the system will look like. Prototypes make it easier to make design decisions, because aspects of the application can be seen and shared before the application is built. Major improvements in communication between users and developers were often seen with the introduction of prototypes. Early views of applications led to fewer changes later and hence reduced overall costs considerably.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>\n</p>, <p>Prototypes can be flat diagrams (often referred to as <a href="/wiki/Wire-frame_model" title="Wire-frame model">wireframes</a>) or working applications using synthesized functionality. Wireframes are made in a variety of graphic design documents, and often remove all color from the design (i.e. use a greyscale color palette) in instances where the final software is expected to have <a href="/wiki/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a> applied to it. This helps to prevent confusion as to whether the prototype represents the final visual look and feel of the application.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>\n</p>, <p>A use case is a structure for documenting the functional requirements for a system, usually involving software, whether that is new or being changed.  Each use case provides a set of <i>scenarios</i> that convey how the system should interact with a human user or another system, to achieve a specific business goal.  Use cases typically avoid technical jargon, preferring instead the language of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/End-user" title="End-user">end-user</a> or <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Domain_expert" title="Domain expert">domain expert</a></i>.  Use cases are often co-authored by requirements engineers and stakeholders.\n</p>, <p>Use cases are deceptively simple tools for describing the behavior of software or systems. A use case contains a textual description of the ways in which users are intended to work with the software or system. Use cases should not describe internal workings of the system, nor should they explain how that system will be implemented. Instead, they show the steps needed to perform a task without sequential assumptions.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Requirement" title="Requirement">Requirements</a> are <a href="/wiki/Categorization" title="Categorization">categorized</a> in several ways. The following are common categorizations of requirements that relate to technical management:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEF01_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-SEF01-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Well-known requirements categorization models include <a href="/wiki/FURPS" title="FURPS">FURPS</a> and FURPS+, developed at <a href="/wiki/Hewlett-Packard" title="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>.\n</p>, <p>Steve McConnell, in his book <i>Rapid Development</i>, details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:\n</p>, <p>This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.\n</p>, <p>Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:\n</p>, <p>One attempted solution to communications problems has been to employ specialists in business or system analysis.\n</p>, <p>Techniques introduced in the 1990s like <a href="/wiki/Software_prototyping" title="Software prototyping">prototyping</a>, <a href="/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> (UML), <a href="/wiki/Use_case" title="Use case">use cases</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Agile_software_development" title="Agile software development">agile software development</a> are also intended as solutions to problems encountered with previous methods.\n</p>, <p>Also, a new class of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Application_Simulation_Software" title="Application Simulation Software">application simulation</a> or application definition tools have entered the market. These tools are designed to bridge the communication gap between business users and the IT organization \xe2\x80\x94 and also to allow applications to be \'test marketed\' before any code is produced.
