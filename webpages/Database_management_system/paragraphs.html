He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a "search" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking <i>A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECodd1970_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTECodd1970-12">[12]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of <a href="/wiki/Linked_list" title="Linked list">linked list</a> of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd\'s idea was to use a "<a href="/wiki/Table_(database)" title="Table (database)">table</a>" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing "sparse" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or <i>relations</i>), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed. Data may be freely inserted, deleted and edited in these tables, with the DBMS doing whatever maintenance needed to present a table view to the application/user.\n</p>, <p>The relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers. The relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship, like a traditional hierarchical model, and many-to-many relationship, like a navigational (network) model. Thus, a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models, as well as its native tabular model, allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models, as the application requires.\n</p>, <p>For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single record, and unused items would simply not be placed in the database. In the relational approach, the data would be <i>normalized</i> into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.\n</p>, <p>Linking the information back together is the key to this system. In the relational model, some bit of information was used as a "<a href="/wiki/Primary_key" title="Primary key">key</a>", uniquely defining a particular record. When information was being collected about a user, information stored in the optional tables would be found by searching for this key. For instance, if the login name of a user is unique, addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the login name as its key. This simple "re-linking" of related data back into a single collection is something that traditional computer languages are not designed for.\n</p>, <p>Just as the navigational approach would require programs to loop in order to collect records, the relational approach would require loops to collect information about any <i>one</i> record. Codd\'s suggestions was a set-oriented language, that would later spawn the ubiquitous <a href="/wiki/SQL" title="SQL">SQL</a>. Using a branch of mathematics known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tuple_calculus" title="Tuple calculus">tuple calculus</a>, he demonstrated that such a system could support all the operations of normal databases (inserting, updating etc.) as well as providing a simple system for finding and returning <i>sets</i> of data in a single operation.\n</p>, <p>Codd\'s paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker" title="Michael Stonebraker">Michael Stonebraker</a>. They started a project known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/INGRES" title="INGRES">INGRES</a> using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979.

Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.\n</p>, <p>IBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PRTV" title="PRTV">PRTV</a>, and a production one, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Business_System_12" title="Business System 12">Business System 12</a>, both now discontinued. <a href="/wiki/Honeywell" title="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> wrote <a href="/wiki/Multics_Relational_Data_Store" title="Multics Relational Data Store">MRDS</a> for <a href="/wiki/Multics" title="Multics">Multics</a>, and now there are two new implementations: <a href="/wiki/Dataphor" title="Dataphor">Alphora Dataphor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rel_(DBMS)" title="Rel (DBMS)">Rel</a>.

In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers.

The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large "chunk".

Examples include computerized <a href="/wiki/Library" title="Library">library</a> systems, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flight_reservation_system" title="Flight reservation system">flight reservation systems</a>, computerized <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parts_inventory_system" title="Parts inventory system">parts inventory systems</a>, and many <a href="/wiki/Content_management_system" title="Content management system">content management systems</a> that store <a href="/wiki/Website" title="Website">websites</a> as collections of webpages in a database.\n</p>, <p>One way to classify databases involves the type of their contents, for example: <a href="/wiki/Bibliographic_database" title="Bibliographic database">bibliographic</a>, document-text, statistical, or multimedia objects. Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases.\n</p>, <p>Connolly and Begg define Database Management System (DBMS) as a "software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEConnollyBegg201464_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEConnollyBegg201464-24">[24]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The DBMS acronym is sometime extended to indicated the underlying <a href="/wiki/Database_model" title="Database model">database model</a>, with RDBMS for <a href="/wiki/Relational_model" title="Relational model">relational</a>,  OODBMS or ORDBMS for the <a href="/wiki/Object_model" title="Object model">object (orientated) model</a> and ORDBMS for Object-Relational.  Other extensions can indicate some other characteristic, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.\n</p>, <p>The functionality provided by a DBMS can vary enormously.  The core functionality is the storage, retrieval and update of data.  <a href="/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd" title="Edgar F.

The trend is to minimise the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as <a href="/wiki/Embedded_database" title="Embedded database">embedded databases</a> the need to target zero-administration is paramount.\n</p>, <p>The large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and can have involved thousands of human years of development effort through their lifetime.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[a]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Early multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via <a href="/wiki/Computer_terminal" title="Computer terminal">terminals</a> or terminal emulation software.

A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customised and linked to a single application.

Some API\'s aim to be database independent, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ODBC" title="ODBC">ODBC</a> being a commonly known example.  Other common API\'s include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/JDBC" title="JDBC">JDBC</a> and <a href="/wiki/ADO.NET" title="ADO.NET">ADO.NET</a>.\n</p>, <p>Database languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as <a href="/wiki/Sublanguage" title="Sublanguage">sublanguages</a>:\n</p>, <p>Database languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:\n</p>, <p>A database language may also incorporate features like:\n</p>, <p>Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the <i>internal</i> (physical) <i>level</i> in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a>, "data about the data", and internal <a href="/wiki/Data_structure" title="Data structure">data structures</a>) to reconstruct the <i>conceptual level</i> and <i>external level</i> from the internal level when needed.  Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the <a href="/wiki/Database_engine" title="Database engine">database engine</a> a.k.a. "storage engine". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems\' <a href="/wiki/File_system" title="File system">file systems</a> as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels\' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).\n</p>, <p>Some DBMSs support specifying which <a href="/wiki/Character_encoding" title="Character encoding">character encoding</a> was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.\n</p>, <p>Various low-level <a href="/wiki/Database_storage_structures" title="Database storage structures">database storage structures</a> are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice.  Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance.  Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also <a href="/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS" title="Column-oriented DBMS">column-oriented</a> and <a href="/wiki/Correlation_database" title="Correlation database">correlation databases</a>.\n</p>, <p>Often storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing <i>materialized views</i>, which consist of frequently needed <i>external views</i> or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing of them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.\n</p>, <p>Occasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to a same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Database_security" title="Database security">Database security</a> deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).\n</p>, <p>Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) is allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.\n</p>, <p>This may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Privilege_(Computing)" title="Privilege (Computing)">privileges</a> to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called "subschemas". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Data_security" title="Data security">Data security</a> in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see <a href="/wiki/Physical_security" title="Physical security">physical security</a>), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Data_encryption" title="Data encryption">data encryption</a>).\n</p>, <p>Change and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic <a href="/wiki/Database_audit" title="Database audit">database audit</a> later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes.  Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this to the database.  Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches.\n</p>, <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Database_transactions" title="Database transactions">Database transactions</a> can be used to introduce some level of <a href="/wiki/Fault_tolerance" title="Fault tolerance">fault tolerance</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_integrity" title="Data integrity">data integrity</a> after recovery from a <a href="/wiki/Crash_(computing)" title="Crash (computing)">crash</a>. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lock_(database)" title="Lock (database)">lock</a>, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction\'s programmer via special transaction commands).\n</p>, <p>The acronym <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ACID" title="ACID">ACID</a> describes some ideal properties of a database transaction: <a href="/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)" title="Atomicity (database systems)">atomicity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)" title="Consistency (database systems)">consistency</a>, <a href="/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)" title="Isolation (database systems)">isolation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)" title="Durability (database systems)">durability</a>.\n</p>, <p>A database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to move, migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different <a href="/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership" title="Total cost of ownership">total costs of ownership</a> or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database\'s transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database\'s conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs.\n</p>, <p>After designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General-purpose_DBMS" title="General-purpose DBMS">general-purpose DBMS</a> can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed <a href="/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interfaces</a> to be used by database administrators to define the needed application\'s data structures within the DBMS\'s respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).\n</p>, <p>When the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application\'s data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.\n</p>, <p>After the database is created, initialised and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (<a href="/wiki/Database_tuning" title="Database tuning">tuning</a>) for better performance; application\'s data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application\'s functionality, etc.\n</p>, <p>Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database\'s data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When this state is needed, i.e., when it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.\n</p>, <p>Static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *<a href="/wiki/Abstract_interpretation" title="Abstract interpretation">Abstract interpretation</a> framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHalderCortesi2011_33-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHalderCortesi2011-33">[32]</a></sup> The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database system has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine grained access control, watermarking, etc.\n</p>, <p>Other DBMS features might include:\n</p>, <p>Increasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as "<a href="/wiki/DevOps" title="DevOps">DevOps</a> for database".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[33]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The first task of a database designer is to produce a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conceptual_data_model" title="Conceptual data model">conceptual data model</a> that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the <a href="/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language" title="Unified Modeling Language">Unified Modeling Language</a>. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like "can a customer also be a supplier?", or "if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?", or "if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.\n</p>, <p>Producing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from <a href="/wiki/Business_process_modeling" title="Business process modeling">business processes</a>, or the analysis of <a href="/wiki/Workflow" title="Workflow">workflow</a> in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.\n</p>, <p>Having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a <a href="/wiki/Database_schema" title="Database schema">schema</a> that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a <a href="/wiki/Logical_data_model" title="Logical data model">logical data model</a> expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms <i>data model</i> and <i>database model</i> are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use <i>data model</i> for the design of a specific database, and <i>database model</i> for the modeling notation used to express that design.)\n</p>, <p>The most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as <a href="/wiki/Database_normalization" title="Database normalization">normalization</a>. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary "fact" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.\n</p>, <p>The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called <i>physical database design</i>, and the output is the <a href="/wiki/Physical_data_model" title="Physical data model">physical data model</a>. A key goal during this stage is <a href="/wiki/Data_independence" title="Data independence">data independence</a>, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.\n</p>, <p>Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining <a href="/wiki/Access_control" title="Access control">access control</a> to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.\n</p>, <p>A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a> can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.\n</p>, <p>Common logical data models for databases include:\n</p>, <p>An object-relational database combines the two related structures.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Physical_data_model" title="Physical data model">Physical data models</a> include:\n</p>, <p>Other models include:\n</p>, <p>Specialized models are optimized for particular types of data:\n</p>, <p>A database management system provides three views of the database data:\n</p>, <p>While there is typically only one conceptual (or logical) and physical (or internal) view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company\'s expenses, but does not need details about employees that are the interest of the <a href="/wiki/Human_resources" title="Human resources">human resources</a> department. Thus different departments need different <i>views</i> of the company\'s database.\n</p>, <p>The three-level database architecture relates to the concept of <i>data independence</i> which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.\n</p>, <p>The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.\n</p>, <p>Separating the <i>external</i>, <i>conceptual</i> and <i>internal</i> levels was a major feature of the relational database model implementations that dominate 21st century databases.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDate200331\xe2\x80\x9332_36-1"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDate200331\xe2\x80\x9332-36">[35]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Academia" title="Academia">academia</a> and in the research and development groups of companies (for example <a href="/wiki/IBM_Research" title="IBM Research">IBM Research</a>).
