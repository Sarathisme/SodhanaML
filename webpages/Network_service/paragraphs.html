[<p>In computer networking, a <b>network service</b> is an application running at the network <a href="/wiki/Application_layer" title="Application layer">application layer</a> and above, that provides data storage, manipulation, presentation, communication or other capability which is often implemented using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Client-server_model" title="Client-server model">client-server</a> or <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> architecture based on application layer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protocol_(computing)" title="Protocol (computing)">network protocols</a>.\n</p>, <p>Each service is usually provided by a <a href="/wiki/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">server component</a> running on one or more computers (often a dedicated server computer offering multiple services) and accessed via a network by <a href="/wiki/Client_(computing)" title="Client (computing)">client components</a> running on other devices. However, the client and server components can both be run on the same machine.\n</p>, <p>Clients and servers will often have a <a href="/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a>, and sometimes other hardware associated with it.\n</p>, <p>Examples are the <a href="/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) which translates domain names to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_protocol" title="Internet protocol">Internet protocol</a> (IP) addresses and the <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol" title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a> (DHCP) to assign networking configuration information to network hosts. <a href="/wiki/Authentication_server" title="Authentication server">Authentication servers</a> identify and authenticate users, provide user account profiles, and may log usage statistics.\n</p>, <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/E-mail" title="E-mail">E-mail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Printing" title="Printing">printing</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Distributed_file_system" title="Distributed file system">distributed (network) file system</a> services are common services on <a href="/wiki/Local_area_network" title="Local area network">local area networks</a>. They require users to have permissions to access the shared resources.\n</p>, <p><b>Other network services include:</b>\n</p>, <p>In <a href="/wiki/Computer_network_programming" title="Computer network programming">computer network programming</a>, the application layer is an <a href="/wiki/Abstraction_layer" title="Abstraction layer">abstraction layer</a> reserved for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Communications_protocol" title="Communications protocol">communications protocols</a> and methods designed for process-to-process communications across an <a href="/wiki/Internet_Protocol" title="Internet Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">computer network</a>. Application layer protocols use the underlying <a href="/wiki/Transport_layer" title="Transport layer">transport layer</a> protocols to establish host-to-host connections for network services.\n</p>, <p>Many Internet Protocol-based services are associated with a particular well-known port number which is standardized by the Internet technical governance.\n</p>, <p>For example, World-Wide-Web servers operate on port 80, and email relay servers usually listen on port 25.\n</p>, <p>Different services use different packet transmission techniques.\n</p>, <p>In general, packets that must get through in the correct order, without loss, use TCP, whereas real time services where later packets are more important than older packets use UDP.\n</p>, <p>For example, file transfer requires complete accuracy and so is normally done using TCP, and audio conferencing is frequently done via UDP, where momentary glitches may not be noticed.\n</p>, <p>UDP lacks built-in <a href="/wiki/Network_congestion" title="Network congestion">network congestion</a> avoidance and the protocols that use it must be extremely carefully designed to prevent network collapse.\n</p>]
