[<p><b>Software deployment</b> is all of the activities that make a <a href="/wiki/Software_system" title="Software system">software system</a> available for use.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the <a href="/wiki/Software_developer" title="Software developer">producer</a> side or at the <a href="/wiki/User_(computing)" title="User (computing)">consumer</a> side or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise <a href="/wiki/Process_(computing)" title="Process (computing)">processes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">procedures</a> within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, "deployment" should be interpreted as a <i>general process</i> that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.\n</p>, <p>When computers were extremely large, expensive and bulky (<a href="/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computer">mainframes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minicomputer" title="Minicomputer">minicomputers</a>), software was often bundled together with the hardware by manufacturers. If <a href="/wiki/Business_software" title="Business software">business software</a> needed to be installed on an existing computer, this might require an expensive, time-consuming visit by a <a href="/wiki/Systems_architect" title="Systems architect">systems architect</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Consultant" title="Consultant">consultant</a>. For complex, on-premises installation of <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_software" title="Enterprise software">enterprise software</a> today, this can still sometimes be the case.\n</p>, <p>However, with the development of <a href="/wiki/Mass_market" title="Mass market">mass market</a> software for the new age of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microcomputers" title="Microcomputers">microcomputers</a> in the 1980s came new forms of software distribution –  first <a href="/wiki/ROM_cartridge" title="ROM cartridge">cartridges</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Cassette_tape" title="Cassette tape">cassette tapes</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a>, then (in the 1990s and later) <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optical_media" title="Optical media">optical media</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">internet</a> and <a href="/wiki/USB_flash_drive" title="USB flash drive">flash drives</a>. This meant that software deployment could be left to the customer. However, it was also increasingly recognised over time that configurability of the software by the customer was important, and that this should ideally have a user-friendly interface (rather than, for example, requiring the customer to edit registry entries on Windows).\n</p>, <p>In pre-internet software deployments, deployments (and their closely related cousin, new software releases) were of necessity expensive, infrequent, bulky affairs. It is arguable therefore that the spread of the internet made end-to-end <a href="/wiki/Agile_software_development" title="Agile software development">agile software development</a> possible. Indeed, the advent of <a href="/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="Cloud computing">cloud computing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="Software as a service">software as a service</a> meant that software could be deployed to a large number of customers in minutes, over the internet. This also meant that typically, deployment schedules were now determined by the software supplier, not by the customers. Such flexibility led to the rise of <a href="/wiki/Continuous_delivery" title="Continuous delivery">continuous delivery</a> as a viable option, especially for less risky <a href="/wiki/Web_application" title="Web application">web applications</a>.\n</p>, <p>The complexity and variability of software products has fostered the emergence of specialized roles for coordinating and engineering the deployment process.  For desktop systems, end-users frequently also become the "software deployers" when they install a software package on their machine. The deployment of <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_software" title="Enterprise software">enterprise software</a> involves many more roles, and those roles typically change as the application progresses from test (pre-production) to production environments.  Typical roles involved in software deployments for enterprise applications may include:\n</p>]
