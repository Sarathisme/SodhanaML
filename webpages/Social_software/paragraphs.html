[<p><b>Social software</b>, also known as <b>Web 2.0 applications</b> or <b>social apps</b>, include communication and interactive tools often based on the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Communication tools typically handle the capturing, storing and presentation of communication, usually written but increasingly including audio and video as well. Interactive tools handle mediated interactions between a pair or group of users. They focus on establishing and maintaining a connection among users, facilitating the mechanics of conversation and talk.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Allen_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Allen-1">[1]</a></sup> Although we do not have a generally accepted definition, social software generally refers to software that makes collaborative behaviour, the organisation and moulding of communities, self-expression, social interaction and feedback possible for individuals. Another important element of the existing definition of "social software" is that it allows for the structured mediation of opinion between people, in a centralized or self-regulating manner. The most improved area for social software is that <a href="/wiki/Web_2.0" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a> <a href="/wiki/Application_software" title="Application software">applications</a> can all promote cooperation between people and the creation of online communities more than ever before.\n</p>, <p>An <i><a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a></i> application or <a href="/wiki/Client_(computing)" title="Client (computing)">client</a> allows one to communicate with another person over a network in real time, in relative privacy. Popular, consumer-oriented clients include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AOL_Instant_Messenger" title="AOL Instant Messenger">AOL Instant Messenger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Hangouts" title="Google Hangouts">Google Hangouts</a>, <a href="/wiki/ICQ" title="ICQ">ICQ</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meebo" title="Meebo">Meebo</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MSN_Messenger" title="MSN Messenger">MSN Messenger</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gaim" title="Gaim">Pidgin</a> (formerly maig), and <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!_Messenger" title="Yahoo!

If the person is online, their name will typically be listed as available for chat. Clicking on their name will activate a chat window with space to write to the other person, as well as read their reply.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" title="Internet Relay Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a> (IRC) and other <a href="/wiki/Online_chat" title="Online chat">online chat</a> technologies allow users to join and communicate with many people at once, publicly. Users may join a pre-existing chat room or create a new one about any topic. Once inside, you may type messages that everyone else in the room can read, as well as respond to/from others. Often there is a steady stream of people entering and leaving. Whether you are in another person\'s chat room or one you\'ve created yourself, you are generally free to invite others online to join you in that room.\n</p>, <p>The goal of collaborative software, also known as groupware, such as Moodle, Landing pages, Enterprise Architecture, and Sharepoint, is to allow subjects to share data \xe2\x80\x93 such as files, photos, text, etc. for the purpose of project work or school work. The intent is to first form a group and then have them collaborate. Clay Shirky defines social software as "software that supports group interaction". Since groupware supports group interaction (once the group is formed), it would consider it to be social software.\n</p>, <p>Originally modeled after the real-world paradigm of electronic <a href="/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin board system">bulletin boards</a> of the world before internet was widely available, <i>internet forums</i> allow users to post a "topic" for others to review. Other users can view the topic and post their own comments in a linear fashion, one after the other. Most forums are public, allowing anybody to sign up at any time. A few are private, gated communities where new members must pay a small fee to join, like the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Something_Awful_Forums" title="Something Awful Forums">Something Awful Forums</a>.\n</p>, <p>Forums can contain many different categories in a hierarchy, typically organized according to topics and subtopics. Other features include the ability to post images or files or to quote another user\'s post with special formatting in one\'s own post. Forums often grow in popularity until they can boast several thousand members posting replies to tens of thousands of topics continuously.\n</p>, <p>There are various standards and claimants for the market leaders of each software category. Various add-ons may be available, including translation and spelling correction software, depending on the expertise of the operators of the bulletin board. In some industry areas, the bulletin board has its own commercially successful achievements: free and paid hardcopy magazines as well as professional and amateur sites.\n</p>, <p>Current successful services have combined new tools with the older <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Newsgroup" title="Newsgroup">newsgroup</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mailing_list" title="Mailing list">mailing list</a> paradigm to produce hybrids like <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!_Groups" title="Yahoo! Groups">Yahoo! Groups</a> and <a href="/wiki/Google_Groups" title="Google Groups">Google Groups</a>. Also as a service catches on, it tends to adopt characteristics and tools of other services that compete. Over time, for example, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Wiki_user_page&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Wiki user page (page does not exist)">wiki user pages</a> have become social portals for individual users and may be used in place of other portal applications.\n</p>, <p>In the past, web pages were only created and edited by web designers that had the technological skills to do so. Currently there are many tools that can assist individuals with web content editing. Wikis allow novices to be on the same level as experienced web designers because wikis provide easy rules and guidelines. Wikis allow all individuals to work collaboratively on web content without having knowledge of any markup languages. A wiki is made up of many content pages that are created by its users. Wiki users are able to create, edit, and link related content pages together. The user community is based on the individuals that want to participate to improve the overall wiki. Participating users are in a democratic community where any user can edit any other user\'s work.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Examples include <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wiktionary" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>, the original <a href="/wiki/Portland_Pattern_Repository" title="Portland Pattern Repository">Portland Pattern Repository</a> wiki, <a href="/wiki/MeatballWiki" title="MeatballWiki">MeatballWiki</a>, CommunityWiki and <a href="/wiki/Wikisource" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a>.

The owner will post a message periodically, allowing others to comment. Topics often include the owner\'s daily life, views on politics or a particular subject important to them.\n</p>, <p>Blogs mean many things to different people, ranging from "online journal" to "easily updated personal website." While these definitions are technically correct, they fail to capture the power of blogs as social software. Beyond being a simple homepage or an online diary, some blogs allow comments on the entries, thereby creating a discussion forum. They also have blogrolls (i.e. links to other blogs which the owner reads or admires) and indicate their social relationship to those other bloggers using the <a href="/wiki/XHTML_Friends_Network" title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN</a> social relationship standard. <a href="/wiki/Pingback" title="Pingback">Pingback</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trackback" title="Trackback">trackback</a> allow one blog to notify another blog, creating an inter-blog conversation.

For example, some sites provide meeting organization facilities for people who practice the same sports. Other services enable business networking (<a href="/wiki/Ryze" title="Ryze">Ryze</a>, <a href="/wiki/XING" title="XING">XING</a> and <a href="/wiki/LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>) and social event meetups (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meetup_(website)" title="Meetup (website)">Meetup</a>).\n</p>, <p>Some large <a href="/wiki/Wiki" title="Wiki">wikis</a> have effectively become social network services by encouraging user pages and portals.\n</p>, <p>Anyone can create their own social networking service using hosted offerings like <a href="/wiki/Ning_(website)" title="Ning (website)">Ning</a>,  or more flexible, installable software like <a href="/wiki/Dolphin_(social_networking_software)" title="Dolphin (social networking software)">Dolphin Pro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elgg_(software)" title="Elgg (software)">Elgg Social Networking Engine</a>, <a href="/wiki/BuddyPress" title="BuddyPress">BuddyPress</a>, <a href="/wiki/SocialEngine" title="SocialEngine">SocialEngine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oxwall" title="Oxwall">Oxwall</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Status.net" title="Status.net">Status.net</a> or <a href="/wiki/Concursive" title="Concursive">Concursive\'s</a> <a href="/wiki/ConcourseConnect" title="ConcourseConnect">ConcourseConnect</a>.\n</p>, <p>Social network search engines are a class of search engines that use social networks to organize, prioritize or filter search results. There are two subclasses of social network search engines: those that use <b>explicit</b> social networks and those that use <b>implicit</b> social networks.\n</p>, <p>Lacking trustworthy explicit information about such viewpoints, this type of social network search engine mines the web to infer the topology of online social networks. For example, the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=NewsTrove&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="NewsTrove (page does not exist)">NewsTrove</a> search engine infers social networks from content - sites, blogs, pods and feeds - by examining, among other things, subject matter, link relationships and grammatical features to infer social networks.\n</p>, <p>Deliberative social networks are webs of discussion and debate for decision-making purposes. They are built for the purpose of establishing sustained relationships between individuals and their government. They rely upon informed opinion and advice that is given with a clear expectation of outcomes.\n</p>, <p>Commercial social networks are designed to support business transaction and to build a trust between an individual and a brand, which relies on opinion of product, ideas to make the product better, enabling customers to participate with the brands in promoting development, service delivery and a better customer experience.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

However, most users of this term restrict its meaning to more recent software genres such as <a href="/wiki/Blog" title="Blog">blogs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wiki" title="Wiki">wikis</a>. Others suggest that the term <i>social software</i> is best used not to refer to a single type of software, but rather to the use of two or more modes of <a href="/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication" title="Computer-mediated communication">computer-mediated communication</a> that result in "community formation."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> In this view, people form online communities by combining one-to-one (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a> and <a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a>), one-to-many (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_pages" title="Web pages">Web pages</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blogs" title="Blogs">blogs</a>) and many-to-many (<a href="/wiki/Wiki" title="Wiki">wikis</a>) communication modes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>  Some groups schedule <a href="/wiki/Real_life" title="Real life">real life</a> meetings and so become "real" communities of people that share physical lives.\n</p>, <p>Most definers of social software agree that they seem to facilitate "bottom-up" community development.

For instance, <a href="/wiki/Tiki_Wiki_CMS_Groupware" title="Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware">Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware</a> has a fine-grained permission system of detailed access control so the site administrator can, on a page-by-page basis, determine which groups can view, edit or view the history. By contrast, <a href="/wiki/MediaWiki" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> avoids per-user controls, to keep most pages editable by most users and puts more information about users currently editing in its recent changes pages.

Eventually, when the expected number of people forwarding\na message drops below 1, the process dies out, but in the interim it may circulate widely - resulting\nin a potentially massive waste of resources.  Much of the time wasted will be due to a sense\nof social obligation to at least scan or check on the title of the message.\n</p>, <p>Bill works for ACME company and sends out an email memo or network message to 20 coworkers.\nSome have to read the message (for example if Bill is their boss or a senior person in the hierarchy), others will just scan it - even if they are uninterested.  Some may comment on it - sharing the response with multiple recipients, others may forward it to others.  Some may not want to read the message, but may feel obligated to read and respond.  The outgoing process of sharing or forwarding takes very little time, but may produce exponentially growing time demands on others.  Over time, employees may find more of their time devoted to social networking demands at work - including scanning, reading, commenting upon, forwarding, and responding to messages.  These social work-obligations may crowd out more productive activities resulting in longer hours with less efficiency.\n</p>, <p>In a sense, social networking at work is similar to a <a href="/wiki/Dilbert" title="Dilbert">large ongoing group meeting</a>.\nSometimes excellent results occur, but other times major amounts of time are wasted.\nSometimes output benefits from everyone\'s input and ongoing consultation, other times,\nindividual work without constant obligation to check in and gain consensus may be more\nproductive. The output of a <a href="/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">"committee"</a> is sometimes worse than that of an individual or small team.\n</p>, <p>As information supply increases, the average time spent evaluating individual content has to decrease. Eventually, much communication is summarily ignored - based on\nvery arbitrary and rapid <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heuristics" title="Heuristics">heuristics</a> that will filter out the information for example by category.
