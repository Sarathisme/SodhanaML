The best-known computer network is the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>.\n</p>, <p>The chronology of significant computer-network developments includes:\n</p>, <p>Computer networking may be considered a branch of <a href="/wiki/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronics_engineering" title="Electronics engineering">electronics engineering</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telecommunications" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">information technology</a> or <a href="/wiki/Computer_engineering" title="Computer engineering">computer engineering</a>, since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n</p>, <p>A computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, <a href="/wiki/Online_chat" title="Online chat">online chat</a>, telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. <a href="/wiki/Distributed_computing" title="Distributed computing">Distributed computing</a> uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n</p>, <p>A computer network may be used by <a href="/wiki/Security_hacker" title="Security hacker">security hackers</a> to deploy <a href="/wiki/Computer_virus" title="Computer virus">computer viruses</a> or <a href="/wiki/Computer_worm" title="Computer worm">computer worms</a> on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a <a href="/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" title="Denial-of-service attack">denial-of-service attack</a>.\n</p>, <p>Computer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Point-to-point_link" title="Point-to-point link">point-to-point telecommunication links</a>, simply transmit data as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bit_stream" title="Bit stream">bit stream</a>. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in <i>packets</i>. A network packet is a formatted unit of <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a> (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packet-switched_network" title="Packet-switched network">packet-switched network</a>. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. Once the packets arrive they are reassembled into their original message.\n</p>, <p>Packets consist of two kinds of data: control information, and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example: source and destination <a href="/wiki/Network_address" title="Network address">network addresses</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Error_detection" title="Error detection">error detection</a> codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in <a href="/wiki/Header_(computing)" title="Header (computing)">packet headers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trailer_(computing)" title="Trailer (computing)">trailers</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Payload_(computing)" title="Payload (computing)">payload data</a> in between.\n</p>, <p>With packets, the <a href="/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)" title="Bandwidth (computing)">bandwidth</a> of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were <a href="/wiki/Circuit_switching" title="Circuit switching">circuit switched</a>. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn\'t overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case the packet is <a href="/wiki/Message_queue" title="Message queue">queued</a> and waits until a link is free.\n</p>, <p>The physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n</p>, <p>The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the <i>physical media</i>) used to link devices to form a computer network include <a href="/wiki/Electrical_cable" title="Electrical cable">electrical cable</a>, <a href="/wiki/Optical_fiber" title="Optical fiber">optical fiber</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radio_waves" title="Radio waves">radio waves</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/OSI_model" title="OSI model">OSI model</a>, these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \xe2\x80\x94 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n</p>, <p>A widely adopted <i>family</i> of transmission media used in <a href="/wiki/Local_area_network" title="Local area network">local area network</a> (LAN) technology is collectively known as <a href="/wiki/Ethernet" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by <a href="/wiki/IEEE_802.3" title="IEEE 802.3">IEEE 802.3</a>. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  <a href="/wiki/Wireless_LAN" title="Wireless LAN">Wireless LAN</a> standards use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radio_waves" title="Radio waves">radio waves</a>, others use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IrDA" title="IrDA">infrared</a> signals as a transmission medium. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_line_communication" title="Power line communication">Power line communication</a> uses a building\'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Power_cabling" title="Power cabling">power cabling</a> to transmit data.\n</p>, <p>The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n</p>, <p>Price is a main factor distinguishing wired- and wireless-technology options in a business. Wireless options command a price premium that can make purchasing wired computers, printers and other devices a financial benefit. Before making the decision to purchase hard-wired technology products, a review of the restrictions and limitations of the selections is necessary. Business and employee needs may override any cost considerations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>There have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media:\n</p>, <p>Both cases have a large <a href="/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time" title="Round-trip delay time">round-trip delay time</a>, which gives slow two-way communication, but doesn\'t prevent sending large amounts of information.\n</p>, <p>Apart from any physical transmission media there may be, networks comprise additional basic <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">system</a> building blocks, such as <a href="/wiki/Network_interface_controller" title="Network interface controller">network interface controllers</a> (NICs), <a href="/wiki/Repeater" title="Repeater">repeaters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethernet_hub" title="Ethernet hub">hubs</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Network_bridge" title="Network bridge">bridges</a>, <a href="/wiki/Network_switch" title="Network switch">switches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Router_(computing)" title="Router (computing)">routers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Modem" title="Modem">modems</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Firewall_(computing)" title="Firewall (computing)">firewalls</a>. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and perform multiple functions.\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Network_interface_controller" title="Network interface controller">network interface controller</a> (NIC) is <a href="/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">computer hardware</a> that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media, and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n</p>, <p>The NIC responds to traffic addressed to a <a href="/wiki/Network_address" title="Network address">network address</a> for either the NIC or the computer as a whole.\n</p>, <p>In <a href="/wiki/Ethernet" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> networks, each network interface controller has a unique <a href="/wiki/MAC_address" title="MAC address">Media Access Control</a> (MAC) address\xe2\x80\x94usually stored in the controller\'s permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six <a href="/wiki/Octet_(computing)" title="Octet (computing)">octets</a>. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Repeater" title="Repeater">repeater</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronic</a> device that receives a network <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" title="Signal (information theory)">signal</a>, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it.  The signal is <a href="/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)" title="Retransmission (data networks)">retransmitted</a> at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n</p>, <p>A repeater with multiple ports is known as an <a href="/wiki/Ethernet_hub" title="Ethernet hub">Ethernet hub</a>. Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model. Repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a <a href="/wiki/Propagation_delay" title="Propagation delay">propagation delay</a> that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row, e.g., the Ethernet <a href="/wiki/5-4-3_rule" title="5-4-3 rule">5-4-3 rule</a>.\n</p>, <p>Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been mostly obsoleted by modern <a href="/wiki/Network_switch" title="Network switch">switches</a>.\n</p>, <p>A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Network_bridge" title="Network bridge">network bridge</a> connects and filters traffic between two <a href="/wiki/Network_segment" title="Network segment">network segments</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Data_link_layer" title="Data link layer">data link layer</a> (layer 2) of the <a href="/wiki/OSI_model" title="OSI model">OSI model</a> to form a single network. This breaks the network\'s collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n</p>, <p>Bridges come in three basic types:\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Network_switch" title="Network switch">network switch</a> is a device that forwards and filters <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OSI_layer_2" title="OSI layer 2">OSI layer 2</a> <a href="/wiki/Datagram" title="Datagram">datagrams</a> (<a href="/wiki/Frame_(networking)" title="Frame (networking)">frames</a>) between <a href="/wiki/Computer_port_(hardware)" title="Computer port (hardware)">ports</a> based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Router_(computing)" title="Router (computing)">router</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Internetworking" title="Internetworking">internetworking</a> device that forwards <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Packet_(information_technology)" title="Packet (information technology)">packets</a> between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a "null" interface, also known as the "black hole" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Modem" title="Modem">Modems</a> (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carrier_signal" title="Carrier signal">carrier signals</a> are <a href="/wiki/Modulation" title="Modulation">modulated</a> by the digital signal to produce an <a href="/wiki/Analog_signal" title="Analog signal">analog signal</a> that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line" title="Digital Subscriber Line">Digital Subscriber Line</a> technology.\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Firewall_(computing)" title="Firewall (computing)">firewall</a> is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in <a href="/wiki/Cyberattack" title="Cyberattack">cyber attacks</a>.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Network_topology" title="Network topology">Network topology</a> is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n</p>, <p>Common layouts are:\n</p>, <p>Note that the physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FDDI" title="FDDI">FDDI</a>, the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location.\n</p>, <p>An <a href="/wiki/Overlay_network" title="Overlay network">overlay network</a> is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-over_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-over-19">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using <a href="/wiki/Modem" title="Modem">modems</a>, before any data network existed.\n</p>, <p>The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the <a href="/wiki/Telephone_network" title="Telephone network">telephone network</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-over_19-1"><a href="#cite_note-over-19">[19]</a></sup> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. <a href="/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol" title="Address Resolution Protocol">Address resolution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Routing" title="Routing">routing</a> are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n</p>, <p>Another example of an overlay network is a <a href="/wiki/Distributed_hash_table" title="Distributed hash table">distributed hash table</a>, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a <a href="/wiki/Associative_array" title="Associative array">map</a>) indexed by keys.\n</p>, <p>Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_service" title="Quality of service">quality of service</a> guarantees to achieve higher-quality <a href="/wiki/Streaming_media" title="Streaming media">streaming media</a>.

The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n</p>, <p>For example, <a href="/wiki/Akamai_Technologies" title="Akamai Technologies">Akamai Technologies</a> manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of <a href="/wiki/Multicast" title="Multicast">multicast</a>).

In a <a href="/wiki/Protocol_stack" title="Protocol stack">protocol stack</a> (also see the <a href="/wiki/OSI_model" title="OSI model">OSI model</a>), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware which sends information across the media.

It involves the originating party <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encrypting</a> data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_providers" title="Internet providers">Internet providers</a> or <a href="/wiki/Application_service_provider" title="Application service provider">application service providers</a>, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both <a href="/wiki/Confidentiality" title="Confidentiality">confidentiality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_integrity" title="Data integrity">integrity</a>.\n</p>, <p>Examples of end-to-end encryption include <a href="/wiki/HTTPS" title="HTTPS">HTTPS</a> for web traffic, <a href="/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</a> for <a href="/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a>, <a href="/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging" title="Off-the-Record Messaging">OTR</a> for <a href="/wiki/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a>, <a href="/wiki/ZRTP" title="ZRTP">ZRTP</a> for <a href="/wiki/Telephony" title="Telephony">telephony</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_Trunked_Radio" title="Terrestrial Trunked Radio">TETRA</a> for radio.\n</p>, <p>Typical <a href="/wiki/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">server</a>-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between <a href="/wiki/Client_(computing)" title="Client (computing)">clients</a> and <a href="/wiki/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">servers</a>, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are <a href="/wiki/Google_Talk" title="Google Talk">Google Talk</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yahoo_Messenger" title="Yahoo Messenger">Yahoo Messenger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dropbox_(service)" title="Dropbox (service)">Dropbox</a>. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering "end-to-end" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a <a href="/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)" title="Backdoor (computing)">back door</a> that subverts negotiation of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Encryption_key" title="Encryption key">encryption key</a> between the communicating parties, for example <a href="/wiki/Skype" title="Skype">Skype</a> or <a href="/wiki/Hushmail" title="Hushmail">Hushmail</a>.\n</p>, <p>The end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the <a href="/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)" title="Exploit (computer security)">technical exploitation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Client_(computing)" title="Client (computing)">clients</a>, poor quality <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Random_number_generator" title="Random number generator">random number generators</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Key_escrow" title="Key escrow">key escrow</a>.

At the time, the dominant web browser was <a href="/wiki/Netscape_Navigator" title="Netscape Navigator">Netscape Navigator</a>. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1961-_2012_13-1"><a href="#cite_note-1961-_2012-13">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Community-of-interest_network" title="Community-of-interest network">community of interest</a> has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> technologies.\n</p>, <p>Network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Router_(computing)" title="Router (computing)">routers</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Network_bridge" title="Network bridge">bridges</a> and <a href="/wiki/Application-level_gateway" title="Application-level gateway">application layer gateways</a>) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, <a href="/wiki/Subnetwork" title="Subnetwork">subnets</a>, map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using <a href="/wiki/Virtual_LAN" title="Virtual LAN"> virtual LAN (VLAN)</a> technology.\n</p>, <p>Both users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an <a href="/wiki/Intranet" title="Intranet">intranet</a> is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-RFC2547_42-0"><a href="#cite_note-RFC2547-42">[42]</a></sup>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An <a href="/wiki/Extranet" title="Extranet">extranet</a> is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-RFC2547_42-1"><a href="#cite_note-RFC2547-42">[42]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Unofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Internet_Service_Providers" title="Internet Service Providers">Internet Service Providers</a> (ISP).

Typically, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Human-readable" title="Human-readable">human-readable</a> names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the <a href="/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS).\n</p>, <p>Over the Internet, there can be <a href="/wiki/Business-to-business" title="Business-to-business"> business-to-business (B2B)</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Business-to-consumer" title="Business-to-consumer"> business-to-consumer (B2C)</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consumer-to-consumer_electronic_commerce" title="Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce">consumer-to-consumer (C2C)</a> communications.
