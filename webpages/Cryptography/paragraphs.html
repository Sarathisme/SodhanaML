It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher\'s algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by <a href="/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs" title="Auguste Kerckhoffs">Auguste Kerckhoffs</a> and is generally called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_Principle" title="Kerckhoffs's Principle">Kerckhoffs\'s Principle</a>; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Shannon" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, the inventor of <a href="/wiki/Information_theory" title="Information theory">information theory</a> and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as <i>Shannon\'s Maxim</i>\xe2\x80\x94\'the enemy knows the system\'.\n</p>, <p>Different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers.

Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Binary_numeral_system" title="Binary numeral system">binary</a> <a href="/wiki/Bit" title="Bit">bit</a> sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\n</p>, <p>Extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent; it began only in the mid-1970s.

A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary <a href="/wiki/Signature" title="Signature">signature</a>; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to <a href="/wiki/Forgery" title="Forgery">forge</a>. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be \'moved\' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for <i>signing</i>, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for <i>verification</i>, in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and <a href="/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm" title="Digital Signature Algorithm">DSA</a> are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of <a href="/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure" title="Public key infrastructure">public key infrastructures</a> and many network security schemes (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport Layer Security">SSL/TLS</a>, many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VPN" title="VPN">VPNs</a>, etc.).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-schneierbook_32-1"><a href="#cite_note-schneierbook-32">[32]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Public-key algorithms are most often based on the <a href="/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory" title="Computational complexity theory">computational complexity</a> of "hard" problems, often from <a href="/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">number theory</a>. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the <a href="/wiki/Integer_factorization" title="Integer factorization">integer factorization</a> problem, while Diffie\xe2\x80\x93Hellman and DSA are related to the <a href="/wiki/Discrete_logarithm" title="Discrete logarithm">discrete logarithm</a> problem. More recently, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic curve cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> has developed, a system in which security is based on number theoretic problems involving <a href="/wiki/Elliptic_curve" title="Elliptic curve">elliptic curves</a>. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as <a href="/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" title="Modular arithmetic">modular</a> multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem" title="Hybrid cryptosystem">hybrid cryptosystems</a>, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm.

In connection with his WWII work at <a href="/wiki/Bell_Labs" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Claude_Shannon" title="Claude Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> proved that the <a href="/wiki/One-time_pad" title="One-time pad">one-time pad</a> cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly <a href="/wiki/Statistical_randomness" title="Statistical randomness">random</a>, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Most <a href="/wiki/Cipher" title="Cipher">ciphers</a>, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brute_force_attack" title="Brute force attack">brute force attack</a>, but the amount of effort needed may be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exponential_time" title="Exponential time">exponentially</a> dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., "work factor", in Shannon\'s terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher.\n</p>, <p>There are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a <a href="/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack" title="Ciphertext-only attack">ciphertext-only attack</a>, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a <a href="/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack" title="Known-plaintext attack">known-plaintext attack</a>, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a <a href="/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack" title="Chosen-plaintext attack">chosen-plaintext attack</a>, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is <a href="/wiki/Gardening_(cryptanalysis)" title="Gardening (cryptanalysis)">gardening</a>, used by the British during WWII. In a <a href="/wiki/Chosen-ciphertext_attack" title="Chosen-ciphertext attack">chosen-ciphertext attack</a>, Eve may be able to <i>choose</i> ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hac_4-6"><a href="#cite_note-hac-4">[4]</a></sup> Finally in a <a href="/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" title="Man-in-the-middle attack">man-in-the-middle</a> attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-43"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the <a href="/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol" title="Cryptographic protocol">protocols</a> involved; see <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma" title="Cryptanalysis of the Enigma">Cryptanalysis of the Enigma</a> for some historical examples of this).\n</p>, <p>Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 2<sup>55</sup> decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a <a href="/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis" title="Linear cryptanalysis">linear cryptanalysis</a> attack against DES requires 2<sup>43</sup> known plaintexts and approximately 2<sup>43</sup> DES operations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-junod_44-0"><a href="#cite_note-junod-44">[44]</a></sup> This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.\n</p>, <p>Public-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is <a href="/wiki/Integer_factorization" title="Integer factorization">integer factorization</a> (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the <a href="/wiki/Discrete_logarithm" title="Discrete logarithm">discrete logarithm</a> problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic curve cryptography">elliptic curve-based</a> version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.\n</p>, <p>While pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called <i><a href="/wiki/Side-channel_attack" title="Side-channel attack">side-channel attacks</a></i>. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, he may be able to use a <a href="/wiki/Timing_attack" title="Timing attack">timing attack</a> to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis.

These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called <i>cryptosystems</i> or <i>cryptographic protocols</i>, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note however, that the distinction between cryptographic <i>primitives</i> and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)" title="RSA (algorithm)">RSA</a> algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive.

Cryptosystems (e.g., <a href="/wiki/ElGamal_encryption" title="ElGamal encryption">El-Gamal encryption</a>) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack" title="Chosen-plaintext attack">chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)</a> security in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Random_oracle_model" title="Random oracle model">random oracle model</a>). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system\'s security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem\'s structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected <a href="/wiki/Backup" title="Backup">backup</a> data).
