[<p><b>Computational geometry</b> is a branch of <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of <a href="/wiki/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Algorithms" title="Algorithms">algorithms</a>, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms" title="Analysis of algorithms">Computational complexity</a> is central to computational geometry, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) and O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) may be the difference between days and seconds of computation.\n</p>, <p>The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in <a href="/wiki/Computer_graphics" title="Computer graphics">computer graphics</a> and computer-aided design and manufacturing (<a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_design" title="Computer-aided design">CAD</a>/<a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing" title="Computer-aided manufacturing">CAM</a>), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_visualization" title="Mathematical visualization">mathematical visualization</a>.\n</p>, <p>Other important applications of computational geometry include <a href="/wiki/Robotics" title="Robotics">robotics</a> (motion planning and visibility problems), <a href="/wiki/Geographic_information_system" title="Geographic information system">geographic information systems</a> (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a> design (IC geometry design and verification), <a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering" title="Computer-aided engineering">computer-aided engineering</a> (CAE) (mesh generation), <a href="/wiki/Computer_vision" title="Computer vision">computer vision</a> (<a href="/wiki/3D_reconstruction" title="3D reconstruction">3D reconstruction</a>).\n</p>, <p>The main branches of computational geometry are:\n</p>, <p>The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_structure" title="Data structure">data structures</a> for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, <a href="/wiki/Polygon" title="Polygon">polygons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polyhedron" title="Polyhedron">polyhedra</a>, etc.\n</p>, <p>Some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>. Consider, for example, the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Closest_pair_problem" title="Closest pair problem">Closest pair problem</a></i>:\n</p>, <p>One could compute the distances between all the pairs of points, of which there are <i>n(n-1)/2</i>, then pick the pair with the smallest distance. This <a href="/wiki/Brute-force_search" title="Brute-force search">brute-force</a> algorithm takes <a href="/wiki/Big_O_notation" title="Big O notation">O</a>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time; i.e. its execution time is proportional to the square of the number of points. A classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). <a href="/wiki/Randomized_algorithm" title="Randomized algorithm">Randomized algorithms</a> that take O(<i>n</i>) expected time,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes O(<i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>) time,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> have also been discovered.\n</p>, <p>The core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways, according to various criteria. The following general classes may be distinguished.\n</p>, <p>In the problems of this category, some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found. Some fundamental problems of this type are:\n</p>, <p>The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space (computer memory) required to solve a given problem instance.\n</p>, <p>In geometric query problems, commonly known as geometric search problems, the input consists of two parts: the <a href="/wiki/Computational_geometry#Geometric_query_problems" title="Computational geometry">search space</a> part and the <a href="/wiki/Query_(complexity)" title="Query (complexity)">query</a> part, which varies over the problem instances. The search space typically needs to be <a href="/wiki/Data_pre-processing" title="Data pre-processing">preprocessed</a>, in a way that multiple queries can be answered efficiently.\n</p>, <p>Some fundamental geometric query problems are:\n</p>, <p>If the search space is fixed, the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by:\n</p>, <p>For the case when the search space is allowed to vary, see "<a href="#Dynamic_problems">Dynamic problems</a>".\n</p>, <p>Yet another major class is the <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_problem_(algorithms)" title="Dynamic problem (algorithms)">dynamic problems</a>, in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data (addition or deletion input geometric elements). Algorithms for problems of this type typically involve <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dynamic_data_structures" title="Dynamic data structures">dynamic data structures</a>. Any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one, at the cost of increased processing time. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Range_searching" title="Range searching">range searching</a> problem may be converted into the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Dynamic_range_searching&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Dynamic range searching (page does not exist)">dynamic range searching</a> problem by providing for addition and/or deletion of the points. The <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_convex_hull" title="Dynamic convex hull">dynamic convex hull</a> problem is to keep track of the convex hull, e.g., for the dynamically changing set of points, i.e., while the input points are inserted or deleted.\n</p>, <p>The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by:\n</p>, <p>Some problems may be treated as belonging to either of the categories, depending on the context. For example, consider the following problem.\n</p>, <p>In many applications this problem is treated as a single-shot one, i.e., belonging to the first class. For example, in many applications of <a href="/wiki/Computer_graphics" title="Computer graphics">computer graphics</a> a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pointer_(graphical_user_interfaces)" title="Pointer (graphical user interfaces)">pointer</a>. However, in some applications, the polygon in question is invariant, while the point represents a query. For example, the input polygon may represent a border of a country and a point is a position of an aircraft, and the problem is to determine whether the aircraft violated the border. Finally, in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics, in <a href="/wiki/Computer-aided_design" title="Computer-aided design">CAD</a> applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures, which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries.\n</p>, <p>In some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries, which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates. For example, in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of N queries, rather than for a single query.
