[<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>, <p><b>Numerical analysis</b> is the study of <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> that use numerical <a href="/wiki/Approximation" title="Approximation">approximation</a> (as opposed to general <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Symbolic_computation" title="Symbolic computation">symbolic manipulations</a>) for the problems of <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_analysis" title="Mathematical analysis">mathematical analysis</a> (as distinguished from <a href="/wiki/Discrete_mathematics" title="Discrete mathematics">discrete mathematics</a>). Numerical analysis naturally finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century also the life sciences, social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. As an aspect of mathematics and <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> that generates, analyzes, and implements algorithms, the growth in power and the revolution in computing has raised the use of realistic mathematical models in science and engineering, and complex numerical analysis is required to provide solutions to these more involved models of the world. <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation" title="Ordinary differential equation">Ordinary differential equations</a> appear in <a href="/wiki/Celestial_mechanics" title="Celestial mechanics">celestial mechanics</a> (planets, stars and galaxies); <a href="/wiki/Numerical_linear_algebra" title="Numerical linear algebra">numerical linear algebra</a> is important for data analysis; <a href="/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation" title="Stochastic differential equation">stochastic differential equations</a> and <a href="/wiki/Markov_chain" title="Markov chain">Markov chains</a> are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.\n</p>, <p>Before the advent of modern computers, <a href="/wiki/Numerical_method" title="Numerical method">numerical methods</a> often depended on hand <a href="/wiki/Interpolation" title="Interpolation">interpolation</a> in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving <a href="/wiki/Differential_equation" title="Differential equation">differential equations</a>.\n</p>, <p>One of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the <a href="/wiki/Yale_Babylonian_Collection" title="Yale Babylonian Collection">Yale Babylonian Collection</a> (<a href="/wiki/YBC_7289" title="YBC 7289">YBC 7289</a>), which gives a <a href="/wiki/Sexagesimal" title="Sexagesimal">sexagesimal</a> numerical approximation of the <a href="/wiki/Square_root_of_2" title="Square root of 2">square root of 2</a>, the length of the <a href="/wiki/Diagonal" title="Diagonal">diagonal</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Unit_square" title="Unit square">unit square</a>. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to compute <a href="/wiki/Square_root" title="Square root">square roots</a>) is extremely important, for instance, in <a href="/wiki/Astronomy" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carpentry" title="Carpentry">carpentry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Construction" title="Construction">construction</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the <a href="/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics" title="Babylonian mathematics">Babylonian</a> approximation of the square root of 2, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.\n</p>, <p>The overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to hard problems, the variety of which is suggested by the following:\n</p>, <p>The rest of this section outlines several important themes of numerical analysis.\n</p>, <p>The field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries. <a href="/wiki/Linear_interpolation" title="Linear interpolation">Linear interpolation</a> was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_method" title="Newton's method">Newton\'s method</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial" title="Lagrange polynomial">Lagrange interpolation polynomial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gaussian_elimination" title="Gaussian elimination">Gaussian elimination</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Euler%27s_method" title="Euler's method">Euler\'s method</a>.\n</p>, <p>To facilitate computations by hand, large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients.  Using these tables, often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions, one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions.  The canonical work in the field is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NIST" title="NIST">NIST</a> publication edited by <a href="/wiki/Abramowitz_and_Stegun" title="Abramowitz and Stegun">Abramowitz and Stegun</a>, a 1000-plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points.  The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available, but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy.\n</p>, <p>The <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_calculator" title="Mechanical calculator">mechanical calculator</a> was also developed as a tool for hand computation. These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s, and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes. But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis, since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done.\n</p>, <p><b>Direct vs iterative methods</b>\n</p>, <p>Consider the problem of solving\n</p>, <p>for the unknown quantity <i>x</i>.\n</p>, <p>For the iterative method, apply the <a href="/wiki/Bisection_method" title="Bisection method">bisection method</a> to <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 3<i>x</i><sup>3</sup> − 24. The initial values are <i>a</i> = 0, <i>b</i> = 3, <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>) = −24, <i>f</i>(<i>b</i>) = 57.\n</p>, <p>We conclude from this table that the solution is between 1.875 and 2.0625. The algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0.2.\n</p>, <p>In a two-hour race, we have measured the speed of the car at three instants and recorded them in the following table.\n</p>, <p>A <b>discretization</b> would be to say that the speed of the car was constant from 0:00 to 0:40, then from 0:40 to 1:20 and finally from 1:20 to 2:00. For instance, the total distance traveled in the first 40 minutes is approximately <span class="texhtml texhtml-big" style="font-size:100%;">(<span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7003720000000000000\xe2\x99\xa0</span>2/3 h</span> × <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7001388888888888888\xe2\x99\xa0</span>140 km/h</span>) = <span class="nowrap"><span class="sortkey" style="display:none">7004933000000000000\xe2\x99\xa0</span>93.3 km</span></span>.

Note that <i>f</i>(1.1) = 10 and <i>f</i>(1.001) = 1000: a change in <i>x</i> of less than 0.1 turns into a change in <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) of nearly 1000. Evaluating <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) near <i>x</i> = 1 is an ill-conditioned problem.\n</p>, <p><b>Well-conditioned problem</b>: By contrast, evaluating the same function <span class="texhtml texhtml-big" style="font-size:100%;"><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 1/(<i>x</i> − 1)</span> near <i>x</i> = 10 is a well-conditioned problem. For instance, <i>f</i>(10) = 1/9 \xe2\x89\x88 0.111 and <i>f</i>(11) = 0.1: a modest change in <i>x</i> leads to a modest change in <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>).\n</p>, <p>Direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps. These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_numbering_formats" title="Computer numbering formats">infinite precision arithmetic</a>. Examples include <a href="/wiki/Gaussian_elimination" title="Gaussian elimination">Gaussian elimination</a>, the <a href="/wiki/QR_decomposition" title="QR decomposition">QR factorization</a> method for solving <a href="/wiki/System_of_linear_equations" title="System of linear equations">systems of linear equations</a>, and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simplex_method" title="Simplex method">simplex method</a> of <a href="/wiki/Linear_programming" title="Linear programming">linear programming</a>. In practice, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Floating_point" title="Floating point">finite precision</a> is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution (assuming <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Numerically_stable" title="Numerically stable">stability</a>).\n</p>, <p>In contrast to direct methods, <a href="/wiki/Iterative_method" title="Iterative method">iterative methods</a> are not expected to terminate in a finite number of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that <a href="/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence" title="Limit of a sequence">converge</a> to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving <a href="/wiki/Residual_(numerical_analysis)" title="Residual (numerical analysis)">the residual</a>, is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps (in general). Examples include <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_method" title="Newton's method">Newton\'s method</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bisection_method" title="Bisection method">bisection method</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jacobi_iteration" title="Jacobi iteration">Jacobi iteration</a>. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.\n</p>, <p>Iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis. Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not, e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GMRES" title="GMRES">GMRES</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method" title="Conjugate gradient method">conjugate gradient method</a>. For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method.\n</p>, <p>Furthermore, continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called <i><a href="/wiki/Discretization" title="Discretization">discretization</a></i>. For example, the solution of a <a href="/wiki/Differential_equation" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Function_(mathematics)" title="Function (mathematics)">function</a>. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a <a href="/wiki/Continuum_(set_theory)" title="Continuum (set theory)">continuum</a>.\n</p>, <p>The study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis. There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Round-off_error" title="Round-off error">Round-off errors</a> arise because it is impossible to represent all <a href="/wiki/Real_number" title="Real number">real numbers</a> exactly on a machine with finite memory (which is what all practical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_computer" title="Digital computer">digital computers</a> are).\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Truncation_error" title="Truncation error">Truncation errors</a> are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a <a href="/wiki/Discretization_error" title="Discretization error">discretization error</a> because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of <span class="mwe-math-element"><span class="mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y" style="display: none;"><math alttext="{\\displaystyle 3x^{3}+4=28}" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">\n  <semantics>\n    <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">\n      <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">\n        <mn>3</mn>\n        <msup>\n          <mi>x</mi>\n          <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">\n            <mn>3</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msup>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mn>4</mn>\n        <mo>=</mo>\n        <mn>28</mn>\n      </mstyle>\n    </mrow>\n    <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\\displaystyle 3x^{3}+4=28}</annotation>\n  </semantics>\n</math></span><img alt="3x^{3}+4=28" aria-hidden="true" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb27471bb2fc45e4efb1852e3563fe0871d8c882" style="vertical-align: -0.505ex; width:12.973ex; height:2.843ex;"/></span>, after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.\n</p>, <p>Once an error is generated, it will generally propagate through the calculation. For instance, we have already noted that the operation + on a calculator (or a computer) is inexact. It follows that a calculation of the type <span class="mwe-math-element"><span class="mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y" style="display: none;"><math alttext="{\\displaystyle a+b+c+d+e}" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">\n  <semantics>\n    <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">\n      <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi>b</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi>d</mi>\n        <mo>+</mo>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n      </mstyle>\n    </mrow>\n    <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\\displaystyle a+b+c+d+e}</annotation>\n  </semantics>\n</math></span><img alt="{\\displaystyle a+b+c+d+e}" aria-hidden="true" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/697d815a1f48e45ef5b0b569d2ef502ebb8876fa" style="vertical-align: -0.505ex; width:16.895ex; height:2.343ex;"/></span> is even more inexact.\n</p>, <p>What does it mean when we say that the truncation error is created when we approximate a mathematical procedure?  We know that to integrate a function exactly requires one to find the sum of infinite trapezoids.  But numerically one can find the sum of only finite trapezoids, and hence the approximation of the mathematical procedure.  Similarly, to differentiate a function, the differential element approaches zero but numerically we can only choose a finite value of the differential element.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Numerical_stability" title="Numerical stability">Numerical stability</a> is an important notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called <i>numerically stable</i> if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation. This happens if the problem is <i><a href="/wiki/Condition_number" title="Condition number">well-conditioned</a></i>, meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount. To the contrary, if a problem is <i>ill-conditioned</i>, then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.\n</p>, <p>Both the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be <i>well-conditioned</i> and/or <i>ill-conditioned</i>, and any combination is possible.\n</p>, <p>So an algorithm that solves a well-conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable. An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well-posed mathematical problem. For instance, computing the square root of 2 (which is roughly 1.41421) is a well-posed problem. Many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> to <span class="mwe-math-element"><span class="mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y" style="display: none;"><math alttext="{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">\n  <semantics>\n    <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">\n      <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">\n        <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">\n          <msqrt>\n            <mn>2</mn>\n          </msqrt>\n        </mrow>\n      </mstyle>\n    </mrow>\n    <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}</annotation>\n  </semantics>\n</math></span><img alt="{\\sqrt {2}}" aria-hidden="true" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff" style="vertical-align: -0.671ex; width:3.098ex; height:3.009ex;"/></span>, for instance <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.4, and then computing improved guesses <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, etc. One such method is the famous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Babylonian_method" title="Babylonian method">Babylonian method</a>, which is given by <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i>+1</sub> = <i>x<sub>k</sub></i>/2 + 1/<i>x<sub>k</sub></i>. Another method, which we will call Method X, is given by <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i>+1</sub> = (<i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub><sup>2</sup> \xe2\x88\x92 2)<sup>2</sup> + <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> We have calculated a few iterations of each scheme in table form below, with initial guesses <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.4 and <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.42.\n</p>, <p>Observe that the Babylonian method converges quickly regardless of the initial guess, whereas Method X converges extremely slowly with initial guess <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.4 and diverges for initial guess <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.42. Hence, the Babylonian method is numerically stable, while Method X is numerically unstable.\n</p>, <p>The field of numerical analysis includes many sub-disciplines. Some of the major ones are:\n</p>, <p><b>Interpolation</b>: We have observed the temperature to vary from 20 degrees Celsius at 1:00 to 14 degrees at 3:00. A linear interpolation of this data would conclude that it was 17 degrees at 2:00 and 18.5 degrees at 1:30pm.\n</p>, <p><b>Extrapolation</b>: If the <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" title="Gross domestic product">gross domestic product</a> of a country has been growing an average of 5% per year and was 100 billion dollars last year, we might extrapolate that it will be 105 billion dollars this year.\n</p>, <p><b>Regression</b>: In linear regression, given <i>n</i> points, we compute a line that passes as close as possible to those <i>n</i> points.\n</p>, <p><b>Optimization</b>: Say you sell lemonade at a <a href="/wiki/Lemonade_stand" title="Lemonade stand">lemonade stand</a>, and notice that at $1, you can sell 197 glasses of lemonade per day, and that for each increase of $0.01, you will sell one glass of lemonade less per day. If you could charge $1.485, you would maximize your profit, but due to the constraint of having to charge a whole cent amount, charging $1.48 or $1.49 per glass will both yield the maximum income of $220.52 per day.\n</p>, <p><b>Differential equation</b>: If you set up 100 fans to blow air from one end of the room to the other and then you drop a feather into the wind, what happens? The feather will follow the air currents, which may be very complex. One approximation is to measure the speed at which the air is blowing near the feather every second, and advance the simulated feather as if it were moving in a straight line at that same speed for one second, before measuring the wind speed again. This is called the <a href="/wiki/Euler_method" title="Euler method">Euler method</a> for solving an ordinary differential equation.\n</p>, <p>One of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Horner_scheme" title="Horner scheme">Horner scheme</a>, since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions. Generally, it is important to estimate and control <a href="/wiki/Round-off_error" title="Round-off error">round-off errors</a> arising from the use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Floating_point" title="Floating point">floating point</a> arithmetic.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Interpolation" title="Interpolation">Interpolation</a> solves the following problem: given the value of some unknown function at a number of points, what value does that function have at some other point between the given points?\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Extrapolation" title="Extrapolation">Extrapolation</a> is very similar to interpolation, except that now we want to find the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Regression_analysis" title="Regression analysis">Regression</a> is also similar, but it takes into account that the data is imprecise.

If the function is <a href="/wiki/Derivative" title="Derivative">differentiable</a> and the derivative is known, then <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_method" title="Newton's method">Newton\'s method</a> is a popular choice. <a href="/wiki/Linearization" title="Linearization">Linearization</a> is another technique for solving nonlinear equations.\n</p>, <p>Several important problems can be phrased in terms of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eigenvalue_decomposition" title="Eigenvalue decomposition">eigenvalue decompositions</a> or <a href="/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition" title="Singular value decomposition">singular value decompositions</a>. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/Image_compression" title="Image compression">spectral image compression</a> algorithm<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> is based on the singular value decomposition. The corresponding tool in statistics is called <a href="/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" title="Principal component analysis">principal component analysis</a>.\n</p>, <p>Optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point also has to satisfy some <a href="/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)" title="Constraint (mathematics)">constraints</a>.\n</p>, <p>The field of optimization is further split in several subfields, depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Linear_programming" title="Linear programming">linear programming</a> deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear. A famous method in linear programming is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simplex_method" title="Simplex method">simplex method</a>.\n</p>, <p>The method of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lagrange_multipliers" title="Lagrange multipliers">Lagrange multipliers</a> can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems.\n</p>, <p>Numerical integration, in some instances also known as numerical <a href="/wiki/Quadrature_(mathematics)" title="Quadrature (mathematics)">quadrature</a>, asks for the value of a definite <a href="/wiki/Integral" title="Integral">integral</a>. Popular methods use one of the <a href="/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" title="Newton\xe2\x80\x93Cotes formulas">Newton\xe2\x80\x93Cotes formulas</a> (like the midpoint rule or <a href="/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule" title="Simpson's rule">Simpson\'s rule</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature" title="Gaussian quadrature">Gaussian quadrature</a>. These methods rely on a "divide and conquer" strategy, whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets. In higher dimensions, where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort, one may use <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" title="Monte Carlo method">Monte Carlo</a> or <a href="/wiki/Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method" title="Quasi-Monte Carlo method">quasi-Monte Carlo methods</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration" title="Monte Carlo integration">Monte Carlo integration</a>), or, in modestly large dimensions, the method of <a href="/wiki/Sparse_grid" title="Sparse grid">sparse grids</a>.\n</p>, <p>Numerical analysis is also concerned with computing (in an approximate way) the solution of <a href="/wiki/Differential_equation" title="Differential equation">differential equations</a>, both ordinary differential equations and <a href="/wiki/Partial_differential_equation" title="Partial differential equation">partial differential equations</a>.\n</p>, <p>Partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing it into a finite-dimensional subspace. This can be done by a <a href="/wiki/Finite_element_method" title="Finite element method">finite element method</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Finite_difference" title="Finite difference">finite difference</a> method, or (particularly in engineering) a <a href="/wiki/Finite_volume_method" title="Finite volume method">finite volume method</a>. The theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from <a href="/wiki/Functional_analysis" title="Functional analysis">functional analysis</a>. This reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation.\n</p>, <p>Since the late twentieth century, most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages. The <a href="/wiki/Netlib" title="Netlib">Netlib</a> repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems, mostly in <a href="/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> and <a href="/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a>.
