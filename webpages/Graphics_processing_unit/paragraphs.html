Software implementations of OpenGL were common during this time, although the influence of OpenGL eventually led to widespread hardware support. Over time, a parity emerged between features offered in hardware and those offered in OpenGL. <a href="/wiki/DirectX" title="DirectX">DirectX</a> became popular among <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> game developers during the late 90s. Unlike OpenGL, Microsoft insisted on providing strict one-to-one support of hardware. The approach made DirectX less popular as a standalone graphics API initially, since many GPUs provided their own specific features, which existing OpenGL applications were already able to benefit from, leaving DirectX often one generation behind. (See: <a href="/wiki/Comparison_of_OpenGL_and_Direct3D" title="Comparison of OpenGL and Direct3D">Comparison of OpenGL and Direct3D</a>.)\n</p>, <p>Over time, Microsoft began to work more closely with hardware developers, and started to target the releases of DirectX to coincide with those of the supporting graphics hardware. <a href="/wiki/Direct3D" title="Direct3D">Direct3D</a> 5.0 was the first version of the burgeoning API to gain widespread adoption in the gaming market, and it competed directly with many more-hardware-specific, often proprietary graphics libraries, while OpenGL maintained a strong following. Direct3D 7.0 introduced support for hardware-accelerated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transform_and_lighting" title="Transform and lighting">transform and lighting</a> (T&amp;L) for Direct3D, while OpenGL had this capability already exposed from its inception. 3D accelerator cards moved beyond being just simple <a href="/wiki/Rasterisation" title="Rasterisation">rasterizers</a> to add another significant hardware stage to the 3D rendering pipeline. The <a href="/wiki/Nvidia" title="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> <i><a href="/wiki/GeForce_256" title="GeForce 256">GeForce 256</a></i> (also known as NV10) was the first consumer-level card released on the market with hardware-accelerated T&amp;L, while professional 3D cards already had this capability. Hardware transform and lighting, both already existing features of OpenGL, came to consumer-level hardware in the \'90s and set the precedent for later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pixel_shader" title="Pixel shader">pixel shader</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vertex_shader" title="Vertex shader">vertex shader</a> units which were far more flexible and programmable.\n</p>, <p>Nvidia was first to produce a chip capable of programmable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pixel_shader" title="Pixel shader">shading</a>, the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GeForce_3" title="GeForce 3">GeForce 3</a></i> (code named NV20). Each pixel could now be processed by a short "program" that could include additional image textures as inputs, and each geometric vertex could likewise be processed by a short program before it was projected onto the screen. Used in the <a href="/wiki/Xbox" title="Xbox">Xbox</a> console, it competed with the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" title="PlayStation 2">PlayStation 2</a> (which used a custom vector DSP for hardware accelerated vertex processing; commonly referred to VU0/VU1). The earliest incarnations of shader execution engines used in <a href="/wiki/Xbox" title="Xbox">Xbox</a> were not general purpose and could not execute arbitrary pixel code. Vertices and pixels were processed by different units which had their own resources with pixel shaders having much tighter constraints (being as they are executed at much higher frequencies than with vertices). Pixel shading engines were actually more akin to a highly customizable function block and didn\'t really "run" a program.
