Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware.

Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Video_arcade" title="Video arcade">video arcades</a> were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games.

In turn, this has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games.

Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> operating system.

Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.\n</p>, <p>Video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game, the most common game controllers are keyboard and mouse for "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_computer_game" title="Personal computer game">PC games</a>, consoles usually come with specific <a href="/wiki/Gamepad" title="Gamepad">gamepads</a>, handheld consoles have built in buttons.

There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer.\n</p>, <p>An example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the <a href="/wiki/Tablet_computer" title="Tablet computer">touchscreen</a>. It allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is <a href="/wiki/Motion_controller" title="Motion controller">motion sensor</a> where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.\n</p>, <p>Video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. <a href="/wiki/Video_game_developer" title="Video game developer">Video game developers</a>, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Game_programmer" title="Game programmer">programmers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">graphic designers</a>.

This is not to say that the age of the "one-man shop" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-numberofdevs_39-0"><a href="#cite_note-numberofdevs-39">[39]</a></sup> where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RAM" title="RAM">RAM</a> or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PDAs" title="PDAs">PDAs</a>).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC). Developers can use <a href="/wiki/Digital_distribution" title="Digital distribution">digital distribution</a> to issue new storylines after the main game is released, such as <a href="/wiki/Rockstar_Games" title="Rockstar Games">Rockstar Games</a> with <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV" title="Grand Theft Auto IV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></i> (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Lost_and_Damned" title="Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned">The Lost and Damned</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Ballad_of_Gay_Tony" title="Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony">The Ballad of Gay Tony</a></i>), or Bethesda with <i><a href="/wiki/Fallout_3" title="Fallout 3">Fallout 3</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Fallout_3_downloadable_content" title="Fallout 3 downloadable content">its expansions</a>.

Smaller packages of DLC are also common, ranging from better in-game weapons (<i><a href="/wiki/Dead_Space_(series)" title="Dead Space (series)">Dead Space</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Just_Cause_2" title="Just Cause 2">Just Cause 2</a></i>), character outfits (<i><a href="/wiki/LittleBigPlanet" title="LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Minecraft" title="Minecraft">Minecraft</a></i>), or new songs to perform (<i><a href="/wiki/SingStar" title="SingStar">SingStar</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Rock_Band" title="Rock Band">Rock Band</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Guitar_Hero" title="Guitar Hero">Guitar Hero</a></i>).\n</p>, <p>A variation of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section to the game that either already exists in the game\'s code or is developed after the game is released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, and other things that weren\'t previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is <a href="/wiki/Bungie" title="Bungie">Bungie</a>\'s <i><a href="/wiki/Destiny_(video_game)" title="Destiny (video game)">Destiny</a></i>, which had the <i><a href="/wiki/Destiny:_Rise_of_Iron" title="Destiny: Rise of Iron">Rise of Iron</a></i> expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, and higher levels, and remade old missions.\n</p>, <p>Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game altogether. Developers may plan out their game\'s life and already have the code for the expansion in the game, but inaccessible by players, who later unlock these expansions, sometimes for free and sometimes at an extra cost. Some developers make games and add expansions later, so that they could see what additions the players would like to have. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, such as <a href="/wiki/Ubisoft" title="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>\'s expansion <i><a href="/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_IV:_Black_Flag" title="Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag">Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag</a> Freedom\'s Cry</i>, which features a different character than the original game.\n</p>, <p>Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game. These <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mod_(computer_gaming)" title="Mod (computer gaming)">mods</a> can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest.

The term "emergent narrative" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by "what happens to the player."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-55"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence" title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</a> in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.\n</p>, <p>An emulator is a program that replicates the behavior of a <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console" title="Video game console">video game console</a>, allowing games to run on a different platform from the original hardware.
