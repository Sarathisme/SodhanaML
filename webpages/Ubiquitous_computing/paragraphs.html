For example, a domestic ubiquitous computing environment might interconnect lighting and environmental controls with personal biometric monitors woven into clothing so that illumination and heating conditions in a room might be modulated, continuously and imperceptibly. Another common scenario posits refrigerators "aware" of their suitably tagged contents, able to both plan a variety of menus from the food actually on hand, and warn users of stale or spoiled food.\n</p>, <p>Ubiquitous computing presents challenges across computer science: in systems design and engineering, in systems modelling, and in user interface design. Contemporary human-computer interaction models, whether <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Command-line" title="Command-line">command-line</a>, menu-driven, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GUI" title="GUI">GUI</a>-based, are inappropriate and inadequate to the ubiquitous case. This suggests that the "natural" interaction paradigm appropriate to a fully robust ubiquitous computing has yet to emerge \xe2\x80\x93 although there is also recognition in the field that in many ways we are already living in a ubicomp world (see also the main article on <a href="/wiki/Natural_user_interface" title="Natural user interface">Natural user interfaces</a>).

If we relax each of these three characteristics we can expand this range into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of ubiquitous computing devices. Hence, three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been proposed:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Poslad_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-Poslad-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Information_Age:_Economy,_Society_and_Culture#The_Rise_of_the_Network_Society" title="The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture">The Rise of the Network Society</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Castells" title="Manuel Castells">Manuel Castells</a> suggests that there is an ongoing shift from already-decentralised, stand-alone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely pervasive computing. In his model of a pervasive computing system, Castells uses the example of the Internet as the start of a pervasive computing system. The logical progression from that paradigm is a system where that networking logic becomes applicable in every realm of daily activity, in every location and every context. Castells envisages a system where billions of miniature, ubiquitous inter-communication devices will be spread worldwide, "like pigment in the wall paint".\n</p>, <p>Ubiquitous computing may be seen to consist of many layers, each with their own roles, which together form a single system:\n</p>, <p><b>Layer 1:</b> <i>task management layer</i>\n</p>, <p><b>Layer 2:</b> <i>environment management layer  </i>\n</p>, <p><b>Layer 3:</b> <i>environment layer </i>\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Mark_Weiser" title="Mark Weiser">Mark Weiser</a> coined the phrase "ubiquitous computing" around 1988, during his tenure as Chief Technologist of the <a href="/wiki/Xerox" title="Xerox">Xerox</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Xerox_PARC" title="Xerox PARC">Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)</a>.

It will be freely available everywhere, like batteries and power     sockets, or oxygen in the air we breathe...We will not need to carry our own devices around with us. Instead,   configurable generic devices, either handheld or embedded in the environment, will bring computation to us, whenever   we need it and wherever we might be.

Some of the key research questions we have been addressing are: What are users\' key concerns regarding privacy management in a ubiquitous context and do they reflect \'expert\' privacy principles? Do these concerns vary as a function of context? Will users have enough confidence in privacy management procedures to hand-over management and administration of their privacy preferences? Motahari, et al., (2007) argue people do not have a complete understanding of the threats to their privacy. While users of ubicomp systems are aware of inappropriate use of their personal information, legal obligations and inadequate security they are less aware of setting preferences for who has access and any social inferences that can be made by observations by other people. They further argue a holistic approach is needed as traditional approaches and current investigations are not enough to address privacy threats in ubiquitous computing. Recognising \xe2\x80\x93 in line with a number of other researchers (Harper &amp; Singleton, 2001; Paine, et al., 2007) \xe2\x80\x93 that privacy concerns are likely to be highly situation-dependent, we have developed a method of enquiry which displays a rich context to the user in order to elicit more detailed information about those privacy factors that underpin our acceptance of ubiquitous computing".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Public policy problems are often "preceded by long shadows, long trains of activity", emerging slowly, over decades or even the course of a century. There is a need for a long-term view to guide policy decision making, as this will assist in identifying long-term problems or opportunities related to the ubiquitous computing environment. This information can reduce uncertainty and guide the decisions of both policy makers and those directly involved in system development (Wedemeyer et al. 2001). One important consideration is the degree to which different opinions form around a single problem. Some issues may have strong consensus about their importance, even if there are great differences in opinion regarding the cause or solution. For example, few people will differ in their assessment of a highly tangible problem with physical impact such as terrorists using new weapons of mass destruction to destroy human life. The problem statements outlined above that address the future evolution of the human species or challenges to identity have clear cultural or religious implications and are likely to have greater variance in opinion about them.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_16-2"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-16">[16]</a></sup>\n</p>]
