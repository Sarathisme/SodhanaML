Britain introduced the <a href="/wiki/Convoy" title="Convoy">convoy</a> system to reduce shipping losses, but while the principle of using warships to accompany merchant ships was generally accepted, it was unclear whether it was better for convoys to be small or large. Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest member, so small convoys can travel faster. It was also argued that small convoys would be harder for German <a href="/wiki/U-boat" title="U-boat">U-boats</a> to detect. On the other hand, large convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker. Blackett\'s staff showed that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort vessels present, rather than the size of the convoy. Their conclusion was that a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><span id="RAF_Coastal_Command's_Operational_Research_Section"></span>\nWhile performing an analysis of the methods used by <a href="/wiki/RAF_Coastal_Command" title="RAF Coastal Command">RAF Coastal Command</a> to hunt and destroy submarines, one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were. As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for night-time operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. This change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> As a result of these findings Coastal Command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces.\n</p>, <p>Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerial-delivered <a href="/wiki/Depth_charge" title="Depth charge">depth charges</a> (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage (because the U-boat wouldn\'t have had time to descend as far as 100 feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets\' locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed. Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and 11% damaged. (If submarines were caught on the surface, even if attacked shortly after submerging, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged). Blackett observed "there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><span id="RAF_Bomber_Command's_Operational_Research_Section"></span>\nBomber Command\'s Operational Research Section (BC-ORS), analyzed a report of a survey carried out by <a href="/wiki/RAF_Bomber_Command" title="RAF Bomber Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

All damage inflicted by German <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare" title="Anti-aircraft warfare">air defences</a> was noted and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily damaged areas. This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft returned with these areas damaged indicated these areas were not vital, and adding armour to non-vital areas where damage is acceptable negatively affects aircraft performance. Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel losses, was also rejected by RAF command. Blackett\'s team made the logical recommendation that the armour be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers which returned. They reasoned that the survey was biased, since it only included aircraft that returned to Britain. The untouched areas of returning aircraft were probably vital areas, which, if hit, would result in the loss of the aircraft.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> This story has been disputed,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> with a similar damage assessment study completed in the US by the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> and was the result of work done by <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Wald" title="Abraham Wald">Abraham Wald</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>.\n</p>, <p>When Germany organized its air defences into the <a href="/wiki/Kammhuber_Line" title="Kammhuber Line">Kammhuber Line</a>, it was realized by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a <a href="/wiki/Bomber_stream" title="Bomber stream">bomber stream</a> they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers.
