Though these large integrated repositories have impacted clinical research significantly, it still faces challenges and barriers. One big problem is the requirement for ethical approval by the institutional review board (IRB) for each research analysis meant for publication.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Huser,_V._2013_PMC_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-Huser,_V._2013_PMC-22">[22]</a></sup> Some research resources do not require IRB approval.

Some issues CRI faces is the ability for the statisticians and the computer system architects to work with the clinical research staff in designing a system and lack of funding to support the development of a new system.  Researchers and the informatics team have a difficult time coordinating plans and ideas in order to design a system that is easy to use for the research team yet fits in the system requirements of the computer team. The lack of funding can be a hindrance to the development of the CRI.  Many organizations who are performing research are struggling to get financial support to conduct the research, much less invest that money in an informatics system that will not provide them any more income or improve the outcome of the research (Embi, 2009).\n</p>, <p>Ability to integrate data from multiple <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clinical_trials" title="Clinical trials">clinical trials</a> is an important part of clinical research informatics.

Computational health informatics is also a branch of health informatics, but is orthogonal to much of the work going on in health informatics because computer scientist\'s interest is mainly in understanding fundamental properties of computation. Health informatics, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with understanding fundamental properties of medicine that allow for the intervention of computers. The health domain provides an extremely wide variety of problems that can be tackled using computational techniques, and computer scientists are attempting to make a difference in medicine by studying the underlying principles of computer science that will allow for meaningful (to medicine) algorithms and systems to be developed. Thus, computer scientists working in computational health informatics and health scientists working in medical health informatics combine to develop the next generation of healthcare technologies.\n</p>, <p>Using computers to analyze health data has been around since the 1950s, but it wasn\'t until the 1990s that the first sturdy models appeared.

Such changes have led to improvements in electronic health records which are now capable of sharing medical information among multiple healthcare stakeholders(Zahabi, Kaber, &amp; Swangnetr, 2015); thereby, supporting the flow of patient information through various modalities of care.\n</p>, <p>Computer use today involves a broad ability which includes but isn\'t limited to physician diagnosis and documentation, patient appointment scheduling, and billing. Many researchers in the field have identified an increase in the quality of healthcare systems, decreased errors by healthcare workers, and lastly savings in time and money (Zahabi, Kaber, &amp; Swangnetr, 2015). The system, however, is not perfect and will continue to require improvement. Frequently cited factors of concern involve usability, safety, accessibility, and user-friendliness (Zahabi, Kaber, &amp; Swangnetr, 2015). As leaders in the field of medical informatics improve upon the aforementioned factors of concern, the overall provision of health care will continue to improve.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-reference_57-0"><a href="#cite_note-reference-57">[57]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_58-0"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-58">[58]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Homer_R._Warner" title="Homer R.

The book describes the path taken as \'early development of health informatics was unorganized and idiosyncratic\'. In the early 1950s, it was prompted by those involved in NHS finance and only in the early 1960s did solutions including those in pathology (1960), radiotherapy (1962), immunization (1963), and primary care (1968)  emerge.  Many of these solutions, even in the early 1970s were developed in-house by pioneers in the field to meet their own requirements. In part, this was due to some areas of health services (for example the immunization and vaccination of children) still being provided by Local Authorities. Interesting, this is a situation which the coalition government proposes broadly to return to in the 2010 strategy Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS (July 2010); stating:\n</p>, <p>"We will put patients at the heart of the NHS, through an information revolution and greater choice and control\' with shared decision-making becoming the norm: \'no decision about me without me\' and patients having access to the information they want, to make choices about their care. They will have increased control over their own care records."\n</p>, <p>These types of statements present a significant opportunity for health informaticians to come out of the back-office and take up a front-line role in supporting clinical practice, and the business of care delivery.\nThe UK health informatics community has long played a key role in the international activity, joining TC4 of the International Federation of Information Processing (1969) which became IMIA (1979). Under the aegis of BCS Health, Cambridge was the host for the first EFMI Medical Informatics Europe (1974) conference and London was the location for IMIA\'s tenth global congress (MEDINFO2001).\n</p>, <p>Since 1997, the Buenos Aires Biomedical Informatics Group, a nonprofit group, represents the interests of a broad range of clinical and non-clinical professionals working within the Health Informatics sphere.\nIts purposes are:\n</p>, <p>The Argentinian health system is heterogeneous in its function, and because of that the informatics developments show a heterogeneous stage.

NPfIT originally divided the country into five regions, with strategic \'systems integration\' contracts awarded to one of several Local Service Providers (LSP).  The various specific technical solutions were required to connect securely with the NHS \'Spine\', a system designed to broker data between different systems and care settings. NPfIT fell significantly behind schedule and its scope and design were being revised in real time, exacerbated by media and political lambasting of the Programme\'s spend (past and projected) against the proposed budget. In 2010 a consultation was launched as part of the new Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government\'s White Paper \'Liberating the NHS\'. This initiative provided little in the way of innovative thinking, primarily re-stating existing strategies within the proposed new context of the Coalition\'s vision for the NHS.\nThe degree of computerization in NHS secondary care was quite high before NPfIT, and the programme stagnated further development of the install base \xe2\x80\x93 the original NPfIT regional approach provided neither a single, nationwide solution nor local health community agility or autonomy to purchase systems, but instead tried to deal with a hinterland in the middle.\n</p>, <p>Almost all general practices in England and Wales are computerized under the GP Systems of Choice (GPSoC)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-77"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> programme, and patients have relatively extensive computerized primary care clinical records. System choice is the responsibility of individual general practices and while there is no single, standardized GP system, GPSoC sets relatively rigid minimum standards of performance and functionality for vendors to adhere to. Interoperation between primary and secondary care systems is rather primitive. It is hoped that a focus on interworking (for interfacing and integration) standards will stimulate synergy between primary and secondary care in sharing necessary information to support the care of individuals.  Notable successes to date are in the electronic requesting and viewing of test results, and in some areas, GPs have access to digital x-ray images from secondary care systems.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> has an approach to the central connection underway which is more advanced than the English one in some ways.

Along this change, China\'s healthcare system also experienced a significant reform to follow and adapt to this historical revolution. In 2003, the data (released from <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China">Ministry of Health of the People\'s Republic of China</a> (MoH)), indicated that the national healthcare-involved expenditure was up to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RMB" title="RMB">RMB</a> 662.33 billion totally, which accounted for about 5.56% of nationwide gross domestic products. Before the 1980s, the entire healthcare costs were covered in central government annual budget. Since that, the construct of healthcare-expended supporters started to change gradually. Most of the expenditure was contributed by health insurance schemes and private spending, which corresponded to 40% and 45% of total expenditure, respectively. Meanwhile, the financially governmental contribution was decreased to 10% only. On the other hand, by 2004, up to 296,492 healthcare facilities were recorded in statistic summary of MoH, and an average of 2.4 clinical beds per 1000 people were mentioned as well.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-IJMI76-p614-620_92-0"><a href="#cite_note-IJMI76-p614-620-92">[92]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Along with the development of information technology since the 1990s, healthcare providers realized that the information could generate significant benefits to improve their services by computerized cases and data, for instance of gaining the information for directing patient care and assessing the best patient care for specific clinical conditions. Therefore, substantial resources were collected to build China\'s own health informatics system. Most of these resources were arranged to construct <a href="/wiki/Hospital_information_system" title="Hospital information system">hospital information system</a> (HIS), which was aimed to minimize unnecessary waste and repetition, subsequently to promote the efficiency and quality-control of healthcare.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-93"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> By 2004, China had successfully spread HIS through approximately 35\xe2\x80\x9340% of nationwide hospitals.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-pmid15569497_94-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid15569497-94">[94]</a></sup> However, the dispersion of hospital-owned HIS varies critically.

The first tier is street health and workplace clinics and these are cheaper than hospitals in terms of medical billing and act as prevention centers. The second tier is district and enterprise hospitals along with specialist clinics and these provide the second level of care. The third tier is provisional and municipal general hospitals and teaching hospitals which provided the third level of care. In a tier of its own is the national hospitals which are governed by the Ministry of Health. China has been greatly improving its health informatics since it finally opened its doors to the outside world and joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2001, it was reported that China had 324,380 medical institutions and the majority of those were clinics. The reason for that is that clinics are prevention centers and Chinese people like using traditional Chinese medicine as opposed to Western medicine and it usually works for the minor cases. China has also been improving its higher education in regards to health informatics. At the end of 2002, there were 77 medical universities and medical colleges. There were 48 university medical colleges which offered bachelor, master, and doctorate degrees in medicine. There were 21 higher medical specialty institutions that offered diploma degrees so in total, there were 147 higher medical and educational institutions. Since joining the WTO, China has been working hard to improve its education system and bring it up to international standards.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-96"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>\nSARS played a large role in China quickly improving its healthcare system. Back in 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS and that made China hurry to spread HIS or Hospital Information System and more than 80% of hospitals had HIS. China had been comparing itself to Korea\'s healthcare system and figuring out how it can better its own system. There was a study done that surveyed six hospitals in China that had HIS. The results were that doctors didn\'t use computers as much so it was concluded that it wasn\'t used as much for clinical practice than it was for administrative purposes. The survey asked if the hospitals created any websites and it was concluded that only four of them had created websites and that three had a third-party company create it for them and one was created by the hospital staff. In conclusion, all of them agreed or strongly agreed that providing health information on the Internet should be utilized.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-97"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Collected information at different times, by different participants or systems could frequently lead to issues of misunderstanding, dis-comparing or dis-exchanging. To design an issues-minor system, healthcare providers realized that certain standards were the basis for sharing information and interoperability, however a system lacking standards would be a large impediment to interfere the improvement of corresponding information systems. Given that the standardization for health informatics depends on the authorities, standardization events must be involved with government and the subsequently relevant funding and supports were critical. In 2003, the Ministry of Health released the Development Lay-out of National Health Informatics (2003\xe2\x80\x932010)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-98"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> indicating the identification of standardization for health informatics which is \'combining adoption of international standards and development of national standards\'.\n</p>, <p>In China, the establishment of standardization was initially facilitated with the development of vocabulary, <a href="/wiki/Medical_classification" title="Medical classification">classification and coding</a>, which is conducive to reserve and transmit information for premium management at national level. By 2006, 55 international/ domestic standards of vocabulary, classification and coding have served in hospital information system. In 2003, the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (<a href="/wiki/ICD-10" title="ICD-10">ICD-10</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/ICD-10_Clinical_Modification" title="ICD-10 Clinical Modification">ICD-10 Clinical Modification</a> (ICD-10-CM) were adopted as standards for diagnostic classification and acute care procedure classification. Simultaneously, the <a href="/wiki/International_Classification_of_Primary_Care" title="International Classification of Primary Care">International Classification of Primary Care</a> (ICPC) were translated and tested in China \'s local applied environment.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-99"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>\nAnother coding standard, named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Logical_Observation_Identifiers_Names_and_Codes" title="Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes">Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes</a> (LOINC), was applied to serve as general identifiers for clinical observation in hospitals. Personal identifier codes were widely employed in different information systems, involving name, sex, nationality, family relationship, educational level and job occupation. However, these codes within different systems are inconsistent, when sharing between different regions. Considering this large quantity of vocabulary, classification and coding standards between different jurisdictions, the healthcare provider realized that using multiple systems could generate issues of resource wasting and a non-conflicting national level standard was beneficial and necessary. Therefore, in late 2003, the health informatics group in Ministry of Health released three projects to deal with issues of lacking national health information standards, which were the Chinese National Health Information Framework and Standardization, the Basic Data Set Standards of Hospital Information System and the Basic Data Set Standards of Public Health Information System.\n</p>, <p><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-IJMI76-p614-620_92-1"><a href="#cite_note-IJMI76-p614-620-92">[92]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Recently, researchers from local universities evaluated the performance of China\'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_Health_Record" title="Electronic Health Record">Electronic Health Record</a> (EHR) Standard compared with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials" title="American Society for Testing and Materials">American Society for Testing and Materials</a> Standard Practice for Content and Structure of Electronic Health Records in the United States (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ASTM" title="ASTM">ASTM</a> E 1384 Standard).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-100"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Summary\n</p>, <p>The table above demonstrates details of this comparison which indicates certain domains of improvement for future revisions of EHR Standard in China.
