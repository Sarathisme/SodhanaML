Technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people, but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil.  Langdon Winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the "making" versus the "uses" of new technologies, and that a narrow focus on "use" leads us to believe that all technologies are neutral in moral standing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Winner,_L._1986_180-1"><a href="#cite_note-Winner,_L._1986-180">[180]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>ix\xe2\x80\x9339</span></sup>  These critiques would have us ask not, "How do we maximize the role or advancement of technology in education?", but, rather, "What are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology?"\n</p>, <p>Winner viewed technology as a "form of life" that not only aids human activity, but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Winner,_L._1986_180-2"><a href="#cite_note-Winner,_L._1986-180">[180]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>ix\xe2\x80\x9339</span></sup> For example, the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity, but they also radically change the process of production itself, thereby redefining what is meant by "work" in such a setting.  In education, standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and assessment. We rarely explicitly reflect on how strange a notion it is that a number between, say, 0 and 100 could accurately reflect a person\'s knowledge about the world. According to Winner, the recurring patterns in everyday life tend to become an unconscious process that we learn to take for granted.  Winner writes,\n</p>, <p>By far the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced.  Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment, economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made.  In that sense technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations. (p. 29) </p>, <p>When adopting new technologies, there may be one best chance to "get it right." Seymour Papert (p. 32) points out a good example of a (bad) choice that has become strongly fixed in social habit and material equipment: our "choice" to use the QWERTY keyboard.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-182"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> The QWERTY arrangement of letters on the keyboard was originally chosen, not because it was the most efficient for typing, but because early typewriters were prone to jam when adjacent keys were struck in quick succession.  Now that typing has become a digital process, this is no longer an issue, but the QWERTY arrangement lives on as a social habit, one that is very difficult to change.\n</p>, <p>Neil Postman endorsed the notion that technology impacts human cultures, including the culture of classrooms, and that this is a consideration even more important than considering the efficiency of a new technology as a tool for teaching.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Postman,_N._1992_167-1"><a href="#cite_note-Postman,_N._1992-167">[167]</a></sup>  Regarding the computer\'s impact on education, Postman writes (p. 19):\n</p>, <p>What we need to consider about the computer has nothing to do with its efficiency as a teaching tool.
