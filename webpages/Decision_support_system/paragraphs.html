Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.\n</p>, <p>While academics have perceived DSS as a tool to support <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decision_making_process" title="Decision making process">decision making process</a>, DSS users see DSS as a tool to facilitate organizational processes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Some authors have extended the definition of DSS to include any <a href="/wiki/System" title="System">system</a> that might support <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decision_making" title="Decision making">decision making</a> and some DSS include a <a href="/wiki/Decision-making_software" title="Decision-making software">decision-making software</a> component; Sprague (1980)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sprague1980_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-sprague1980-2">[2]</a></sup> defines a properly termed DSS as follows:\n</p>, <p>DSSs include <a href="/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems" title="Knowledge-based systems">knowledge-based systems</a>. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.\n</p>, <p>Typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes:\n</p>, <p>The concept of decision support has evolved mainly from the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the implementation work done in the 1960s.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Scott_Morton_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Scott_Morton-3">[3]</a></sup> DSS became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s, before gaining in intensity during the 1980s. In the middle and late 1980s, <a href="/wiki/Executive_information_system" title="Executive information system">executive information systems</a> (EIS), group decision support systems (GDSS), and organizational decision support systems (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS.\n</p>, <p>According to Sol (1987)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-HGS87_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-HGS87-4">[4]</a></sup> the definition and scope of DSS has been migrating over the years: in the 1970s DSS was described as "a computer-based system to aid decision making"; in the late 1970s the DSS movement started focusing on "interactive computer-based systems which help decision-makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill-structured problems"; in the 1980s DSS should provide systems "using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities", and towards the end of 1980s DSS faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-HGS87_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-HGS87-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In 1987, <a href="/wiki/Texas_Instruments" title="Texas Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> completed development of the Gate Assignment Display System (GADS) for <a href="/wiki/United_Airlines" title="United Airlines">United Airlines</a>.

As the turn of the millennium approached, new Web-based analytical applications were introduced.\n</p>, <p>The advent of more and better reporting technologies has seen DSS start to emerge as a critical component of  <a href="/wiki/Management" title="Management">management</a> design.  Examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of DSS in the education environment.\n</p>, <p>DSS also have a weak connection to the <a href="/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a> paradigm of <a href="/wiki/Hypertext" title="Hypertext">hypertext</a>.  Both the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Vermont" title="University of Vermont">University of Vermont</a> <a href="/wiki/Problem-Oriented_Medical_Information_System" title="Problem-Oriented Medical Information System">PROMIS</a> system (for medical decision making) and the Carnegie Mellon <a href="/wiki/ZOG_(hypertext)" title="ZOG (hypertext)">ZOG</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/KMS_(Hypertext)" title="KMS (Hypertext)">KMS</a> system (for military and business decision making) were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research.

A <i>passive DSS</i> is a system that aids the process of decision making, but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions. An <i>active DSS</i> can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions. A <i>cooperative DSS</i> allows for an iterative process between human and system towards the achievement of a consolidated solution: the decision maker (or its advisor) can modify, complete, or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system, before sending them back to the system for validation, and likewise the system again improves, completes, and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to them for validation.\n</p>, <p>Another taxonomy for DSS, according to the mode of assistance, has been created by Daniel Power: he  differentiates <i>communication-driven DSS</i>, <i>data-driven DSS</i>, <i>document-driven DSS</i>, <i>knowledge-driven DSS</i>, and <i>model-driven DSS</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Power_2002_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Power_2002-7">[7]</a></sup> \n</p>, <p>Using scope as the criterion, Power<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Power_1996_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Power_1996-10">[10]</a></sup> differentiates <i>enterprise-wide DSS</i> and <i>desktop DSS</i>.

Due to DSS all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts, graphs i.e. in a summarized way, which helps the management to take strategic decision. For example, one of the DSS applications is the management and development of complex anti-terrorism systems.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Zhang_&amp;_Babovic_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-Zhang_&amp;_Babovic-18">[18]</a></sup> Other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs.\n</p>, <p>A growing area of DSS application, concepts, principles, and techniques is in <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agricultural production</a>, marketing for <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_development" title="Sustainable development">sustainable development</a>.  For example, the <a href="/wiki/DSSAT" title="DSSAT"> DSSAT4</a> package,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> developed through financial support of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USAID" title="USAID">USAID</a> during the 80s and 90s, has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision-making at the farm and policy levels. <a href="/wiki/Precision_agriculture" title="Precision agriculture">Precision agriculture</a> seeks to tailor decisions to particular portions of farm fields.

The Community of Practice of Forest Management Decision Support Systems provides a large repository on knowledge about the construction and use of forest Decision Support Systems.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A specific example concerns the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway" title="Canadian National Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> system, which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system.
