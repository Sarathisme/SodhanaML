[<p><b>Visualization</b> or <b>visualisation</b> (see <a href="/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise,_-ize_(-isation,_-ization)" title="American and British English spelling differences">spelling differences</a>) is any technique for creating <a href="/wiki/Image" title="Image">images</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diagram" title="Diagram">diagrams</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Animation" title="Animation">animations</a> to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of humanity. Examples from history include <a href="/wiki/Cave_painting" title="Cave painting">cave paintings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" title="Egyptian hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, Greek <a href="/wiki/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>\'s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.\n</p>, <p>Visualization today has ever-expanding applications in science, education, engineering (e.g., product visualization), <a href="/wiki/Interactive_visualization" title="Interactive visualization">interactive multimedia</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medical_visualization" title="Medical visualization">medicine</a>, etc. Typical of a visualization application is the field of <a href="/wiki/Computer_graphics" title="Computer graphics">computer graphics</a>. The invention of computer graphics may be the most important development in visualization since the invention of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Perspective_projection" title="Perspective projection">central perspective</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> period. The development of <a href="/wiki/Animation" title="Animation">animation</a> also helped advance visualization.\n</p>, <p>The use of visualization to present information is not a new phenomenon. It has been used in maps, scientific drawings, and data plots for over a thousand years. Examples from <a href="/wiki/Cartography" title="Cartography">cartography</a> include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geographia_(Ptolemy)" title="Geographia (Ptolemy)">Ptolemy\'s Geographia</a> (2nd Century AD), a map of China (1137 AD), and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard" title="Charles Joseph Minard">Minard</a>\'s map (1861) of <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>\'s invasion of Russia a century and a half ago. Most of the concepts learned in devising these images carry over in a straightforward manner to computer visualization. <a href="/wiki/Edward_Tufte" title="Edward Tufte">Edward Tufte</a> has written three critically acclaimed books that explain many of these principles.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Computer graphics has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the publication of Visualization in Scientific Computing, a special issue of Computer Graphics.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Since then, there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the <a href="/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society" title="IEEE Computer Society">IEEE Computer Society</a> and <a href="/wiki/ACM_SIGGRAPH" title="ACM SIGGRAPH">ACM SIGGRAPH</a>, devoted to the general topic, and special areas in the field, for example volume visualization.\n</p>, <p>Most people are familiar with the digital animations produced to present <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meteorological" title="Meteorological">meteorological</a> data during weather reports on <a href="/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a>, though few can distinguish between those models of reality and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Satellite_photo" title="Satellite photo">satellite photos</a> that are also shown on such programs. TV also offers scientific visualizations when it shows computer drawn and animated reconstructions of road or airplane accidents. Some of the most popular examples of scientific visualizations are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer-generated_images" title="Computer-generated images">computer-generated images</a> that show real <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a> in action, out in the void far beyond Earth, or on other <a href="/wiki/Planet" title="Planet">planets</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The abstract visualizations show completely conceptual constructs in 2D or 3D. These generated shapes are completely arbitrary. The model-based visualizations either place overlays of data on real or digitally constructed images of reality or make a digital construction of a real object directly from the scientific data.\n</p>, <p>Scientific visualization is usually done with specialized <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a>, though there are a few exceptions, noted below. Some of these specialized programs have been released as <a href="/wiki/Open-source_software" title="Open-source software">open source</a> software, having very often its origins in universities, within an academic environment where sharing software tools and giving access to the source code is common. There are also many <a href="/wiki/Proprietary_software" title="Proprietary software">proprietary software</a> packages of scientific visualization tools.\n</p>, <p>Models and frameworks for building visualizations include the <a href="/wiki/Dataflow" title="Dataflow">data flow</a> models popularized by systems such as AVS, IRIS Explorer, and VTK toolkit, and data state models in spreadsheet systems such as the Spreadsheet for Visualization and Spreadsheet for Images.\n</p>, <p>As a subject in <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scientific_visualization" title="Scientific visualization">scientific visualization</a> is the use of interactive, sensory representations, typically visual, of abstract data to reinforce <a href="/wiki/Cognition" title="Cognition">cognition</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> building, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reasoning" title="Reasoning">reasoning</a>. <a href="/wiki/Data_visualization" title="Data visualization">Data visualization</a> is a related subcategory of visualization dealing with <a href="/wiki/Statistical_graphics" title="Statistical graphics">statistical graphics</a> and geographic or spatial data (as in <a href="/wiki/Thematic_map" title="Thematic map">thematic cartography</a>) that is abstracted in schematic form.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MF08_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-MF08-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Scientific_visualization" title="Scientific visualization">Scientific visualization</a> is the transformation, selection, or representation of data from simulations or experiments, with an implicit or explicit geometric structure, to allow the exploration, analysis, and understanding of the data.

There are several different techniques to visualize scientific data, with <a href="/wiki/Isosurface" title="Isosurface">isosurface reconstruction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volume_rendering" title="Volume rendering">direct volume rendering</a> being the more common.\n</p>, <p>Educational visualization is using a <a href="/wiki/Simulation" title="Simulation">simulation</a> to create an image of something so it can be taught about. This is very useful when teaching about a topic that is difficult to otherwise see, for example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_structure" title="Atomic structure">atomic structure</a>, because atoms are far too small to be studied easily without expensive and difficult to use scientific equipment.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Information_visualization" title="Information visualization">Information visualization</a> concentrates on the use of computer-supported tools to explore large amount of abstract data. The term "information visualization" was originally coined by the User Interface Research Group at Xerox PARC and included Jock Mackinlay.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Important aspects of information visualization are dynamics of visual representation and the interactivity. Strong techniques enable the user to modify the visualization in real-time, thus affording unparalleled perception of patterns and structural relations in the abstract data in question.\n</p>, <p>The use of visual representations to transfer knowledge between at least two persons aims to improve the transfer of <a href="/wiki/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> by using <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> and non-computer-based visualization methods complementarily.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Examples of such visual formats are <a href="/wiki/Sketch_(drawing)" title="Sketch (drawing)">sketches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diagram" title="Diagram">diagrams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Image" title="Image">images</a>, <a href="/wiki/Object_(image_processing)" title="Object (image processing)">objects</a>, interactive visualizations, information visualization applications, and imaginary visualizations as in <a href="/wiki/Narrative" title="Narrative">stories</a>.
