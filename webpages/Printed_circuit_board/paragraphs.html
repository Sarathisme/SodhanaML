Components are generally <a href="/wiki/Soldering" title="Soldering">soldered</a> onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.\n</p>, <p>Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products. They are also used in some electrical products, such as passive switch boxes.\n</p>, <p>Alternatives to PCBs include <a href="/wiki/Wire_wrap" title="Wire wrap">wire wrap</a> and <a href="/wiki/Point-to-point_construction" title="Point-to-point construction">point-to-point construction</a>, both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Specialized CAD software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation.  Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout only has to be done once.  PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.\n</p>, <p>PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (outer and inner layers of copper, alternating with layers of substrate).  Multi-layer PCBs allow for much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components.  The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surface_mount_technology" title="Surface mount technology">surface mount technology</a>.  However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.\n</p>, <p>The world market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> In 2018, the Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market Analysis Report estimated that the PCB market would reach $79 billion by 2024.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Before the development of printed circuit boards electrical and electronic circuits were <a href="/wiki/Point-to-point_construction" title="Point-to-point construction">wired point-to-point</a> on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering, or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.\n</p>, <p>Development of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century. In 1903, a German inventor, Albert Hanson, described flat foil conductors laminated to an insulating board, in multiple layers. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> experimented with chemical methods of plating conductors onto linen paper in 1904. Arthur Berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in the UK, and in the United States Max Schoop obtained a patent<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask. Charles Ducas in 1927 patented a method of electroplating circuit patterns.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Harper03_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Harper03-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The Austrian engineer <a href="/wiki/Paul_Eisler" title="Paul Eisler">Paul Eisler</a> invented the printed circuit as part of a <a href="/wiki/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines. Around 1943 the USA began to use the technology on a large scale to make <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proximity_fuse" title="Proximity fuse">proximity fuses</a> for use in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Harper03_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-Harper03-5">[5]</a></sup> After the war, in 1948, the USA released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the <i>Auto-Sembly</i> process was developed by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Dummer" title="Geoffrey Dummer">Geoffrey Dummer</a>, then at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Radar_Establishment" title="Royal Radar Establishment">RRDE</a>.\n</p>, <p>Even as circuit boards became available, the point-to-point chassis construction method remained in common use in industry (such as TV and hi-fi sets) into at least the late 1960s. Printed circuit boards were introduced to  reduce the size, weight, and cost of parts of the circuitry. In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain  one or more circuit boards.\n</p>, <p>Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was <a href="/wiki/John_Sargrove" title="John Sargrove">John Sargrove</a>\'s 1936\xe2\x80\x931947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a <a href="/wiki/Bakelite" title="Bakelite">Bakelite</a> plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.\n</p>, <p>During World War II, the development of the anti-aircraft <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Proximity_fuse" title="Proximity fuse">proximity fuse</a> required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Screenprinting" title="Screenprinting">screenprinted</a> with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for <a href="/wiki/Resistor" title="Resistor">resistors</a>, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</a> awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein the <a href="/wiki/IEEE_Cledo_Brunetti_Award" title="IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award">Cledo Brunetti Award</a> for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate.  Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison" title="University of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x93Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-IEEE_Recipient_list_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-IEEE_Recipient_list-8">[8]</a></sup> This invention also represents a step in the development of <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a> technology, as not only wiring but also passive components were fabricated on the ceramic substrate.\n</p>, <p>Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and <a href="/wiki/Solder" title="Solder">soldered</a> to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called <a href="/wiki/Through-hole_technology" title="Through-hole technology"><i>through-hole</i> construction</a>. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Signal_Corps" title="United States Army Signal Corps">United States Army Signal Corps</a> developed the <i>Auto-Sembly</i> process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and <a href="/wiki/Dip_soldering" title="Dip soldering">dip soldered</a>. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a <a href="/wiki/Wave_soldering" title="Wave soldering">wave-soldering</a> machine. However, the wires and holes are inefficient since drilling holes is expensive and consumes drill bits and the protruding wires are cut off and discarded.\n</p>, <p>From the 1980s onward, small surface mount parts have been used increasingly instead of through-hole components; this has led to smaller boards for a given functionality and lower production costs, but with some additional difficulty in servicing faulty boards.\n</p>, <p>In the 1990s the use of multilayer surface boards became more frequent. As a result, size was further minimized and both flexible and rigid PCBs were incorporated in different devices. In 1995 PCB manufacturers began using microvia technology to produce High-Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>HDI technology allows for a denser design on the PCB and significantly smaller components. As a result, components can be closer and the paths between them shorter. HDIs use blind/buried vias, or a combination that includes microvias. With multi-layer HDI PCBs the interconnection of stacked vias is even stronger, thus enhancing reliability in all conditions. The most common applications for HDI technology are computer and mobile phone components as well as medical equipment and military communication equipment. A 4-layer HDI microvia PCB Cost is equivalent in quality to an 8-layer through-hole PCB. However, the cost is much lower.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Recent advances in 3D printing have meant that there are several new techniques in PCB creation. 3D printed electronics (PEs) can be utilized to print items layer by layer and subsequently the item can be printed with a liquid ink that contains electronic functionalities.\n</p>, <p>Manufacturers may not support component-level repair of printed circuit boards because of the relatively low cost to replace compared with the time and cost of troubleshooting to a component level. In board-level repair, the technician identifies the board (PCA) on which the fault resides and replaces it. This shift is economically efficient from a manufacturer\'s point of view but is also materially wasteful, as a circuit board with hundreds of good components may be discarded and replaced due to the failure of one minor and inexpensive part such as a resistor or capacitor. This practice is a significant contributor to the problem of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/E-waste" title="E-waste">e-waste</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>\n</p>, <p>A basic PCB consists of a flat sheet of insulating material and a layer of copper foil, laminated to the substrate. Chemical etching divides the copper into separate conducting lines called tracks or <i>circuit traces</i>, pads for connections, vias to pass connections between layers of copper, and features such as solid conductive areas for EM shielding or other purposes. The tracks function as wires fixed in place, and are insulated from each other by air and the board substrate material.  The surface of a PCB may have a coating that protects the copper from corrosion and reduces the chances of solder shorts between traces or undesired electrical contact with stray bare wires. For its function in helping to prevent solder shorts, the coating is called solder resist.\n</p>, <p>A printed circuit board can have multiple copper layers.  A two-layer board has copper on both sides; multi layer boards sandwich additional copper layers between layers of insulating material. Conductors on different layers are connected with <a href="/wiki/Via_(electronics)" title="Via (electronics)">vias</a>, which are copper-plated holes that function as electrical tunnels through the insulating substrate. Through-hole component leads sometimes also effectively function as vias.  After two-layer PCBs, the next step up is usually four-layer. Often two layers are dedicated as power supply and ground planes, and the other two are used for signal wiring between components.\n</p>, <p>"Through hole" components are mounted by their wire leads passing through the board and soldered to traces on the other side. "Surface mount" components are attached by their leads to copper traces on the same side of the board.  A board may use both methods for mounting components. PCBs with only through-hole mounted components are now uncommon. Surface mounting is used for transistors, diodes, IC chips, resistors and capacitors. Through-hole mounting may be used for some large components such as electrolytic capacitors and connectors.\n</p>, <p>The  pattern to be etched into each copper layer of a PCB is called the "artwork".  The etching is usually done using <a href="/wiki/Photoresist" title="Photoresist">photoresist</a> which is coated onto the PCB, then exposed to light projected in the pattern of the artwork. The resist material protects the copper from dissolution into the etching solution.  The etched board is then cleaned. A PCB design can be mass-reproduced in a way similar to the way photographs can be mass-duplicated from film negatives using a photographic printer.\n</p>, <p>In multi-layer boards, the layers of material are laminated together in an alternating sandwich: copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc.; each plane of copper is etched, and any internal vias (that will not extend to both outer surfaces of the finished multilayer board) are plated-through, before the layers are laminated together. Only the outer layers need be coated; the inner copper layers are protected by the adjacent substrate layers.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/FR-4" title="FR-4">FR-4</a> <a href="/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic" title="Fibre-reinforced plastic">glass epoxy</a> is the most common insulating substrate. Another substrate material is cotton paper impregnated with phenolic resin, often tan or brown.\n</p>, <p>When a PCB has no components installed, it is less ambiguously called a <i>printed wiring board</i> (<i>PWB</i>) or <i>etched wiring board</i>. However, the term "printed wiring board" has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a <i>printed circuit assembly</i> (<i>PCA</i>), <i>printed circuit board assembly</i> or <i>PCB assembly</i> (<i>PCBA</i>). In informal usage, the term "printed circuit board" most commonly means "printed circuit assembly" (with components). The <a href="/wiki/IPC_(electronics)" title="IPC (electronics)">IPC</a> preferred term for assembled boards is <i>circuit card assembly</i> (<i>CCA</i>),<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and for assembled <a href="/wiki/Backplane" title="Backplane">backplanes</a> it is <i>backplane assemblies</i>. "Card" is another widely used informal term for a "printed circuit assembly".\n</p>, <p>A PCB may be "silkscreen" printed with a legend  identifying the components, test points, or identifying text. Originally, an actual silkscreen printing process was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used instead.  Normally the screen printing is not significant to the function of the PCBA.\n</p>, <p>A minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a <i>breakout board</i>. The purpose of a breakout board is to "break out" the leads of a component on separate terminals so that manual connections to them can be made easily. Breakout boards are especially used for surface-mount components or any components with fine lead pitch.\n</p>, <p>Advanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides.  Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part\'s mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be <a href="/wiki/Soldering" title="Soldering">soldered</a> either manually or by a <a href="/wiki/Wave_soldering" title="Wave soldering">wave soldering</a> machine.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MAT2001_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-MAT2001-15">[15]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Through-hole manufacture adds to board cost by requiring many holes to be drilled accurately, and it limits the available routing area for <a href="/wiki/Signal_trace" title="Signal trace">signal traces</a> on layers immediately below the top layer on multi-layer boards, since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. Once surface-mounting came into use, small-sized SMD components were used where possible, with through-hole mounting only of components unsuitably large for surface-mounting due to power requirements or mechanical limitations, or subject to mechanical stress which might damage the PCB (e.g. by lifting the copper off the board surface).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.\nSurface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates.  Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper.  However, prices of semiconductor <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Surface_mount_device" title="Surface mount device">surface mount devices</a> (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages, and some wire-ended components, such as <a href="/wiki/1N4148_signal_diode" title="1N4148 signal diode">1N4148</a> small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.\n</p>, <p>Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the <a href="/wiki/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a> foil that remains after etching. Its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electrical_resistance" title="Electrical resistance">resistance</a>, determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a <a href="/wiki/Ground_plane" title="Ground plane">ground plane</a> for shielding and power return.

PCBs to be sold in the EU must be RoHS-compliant, meaning that all manufacturing processes must not involve the use of lead, all solder used must be lead-free, and all components mounted on the board must be free of lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Laminates are manufactured by curing under pressure and temperature layers of cloth or paper with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thermoset" title="Thermoset">thermoset</a> <a href="/wiki/Resin" title="Resin">resin</a> to form an integral final piece of uniform thickness.

Some of these dielectrics are <a href="/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene" title="Polytetrafluoroethylene">polytetrafluoroethylene</a> (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are <a href="/wiki/FR-2" title="FR-2">FR-2</a> (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), <a href="/wiki/FR-4" title="FR-4">FR-4</a> (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with <a href="/wiki/Ball_grid_array" title="Ball grid array">ball grid array</a> (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.\n</p>, <p>FR-4 is by far the most common material used today. The board stock with unetched copper on it is called "copper-clad laminate".\n</p>, <p>With decreasing size of board features and increasing frequencies, small nonhomogeneities like uneven distribution of fiberglass or other filler, thickness variations, and bubbles in the resin matrix, and the associated local variations in the dielectric constant, are gaining importance.\n</p>, <p>The circuitboard substrates are usually dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin) and a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes nonwoven, glass fibers, sometimes even paper), and in some cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).\n</p>, <p>The reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials: woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern. Nonwoven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.\n</p>, <p>The substrates are characterized by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glass_transition_temperature" title="Glass transition temperature">glass transition temperature</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tensile_strength" title="Tensile strength">tensile strength</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shear_strength" title="Shear strength">shear strength</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thermal_expansion" title="Thermal expansion">thermal expansion</a>), electrical (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dielectric_constant" title="Dielectric constant">dielectric constant</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Loss_tangent" title="Loss tangent">loss tangent</a>, <a href="/wiki/Breakdown_voltage" title="Breakdown voltage">dielectric breakdown voltage</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leakage_current" title="Leakage current">leakage current</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Tracking_resistance&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Tracking resistance (page does not exist)">tracking resistance</a>...), and others (e.g. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Moisture_absorption&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Moisture absorption (page does not exist)">moisture absorption</a>).\n</p>, <p>At the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glass_transition_temperature" title="Glass transition temperature">glass transition temperature</a> the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding T<sub>g</sub> then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below T<sub>g</sub> the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require a matrix with a high T<sub>g</sub>.\n</p>, <p>The materials used determine the substrate\'s dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the <a href="/wiki/Phase_velocity" title="Phase velocity">signal propagation speed</a>, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat a dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as is achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.\n</p>, <p>Dielectric breakdown voltage determines the maximum voltage gradient the material can be subjected to before suffering a breakdown (conduction, or arcing, through the dielectric).\n</p>, <p>Tracking resistance determines how the material resists high voltage electrical discharges creeping over the board surface.\n</p>, <p>Loss tangent determines how much of the electromagnetic energy from the signals in the conductors is absorbed in the board material. This factor is important for high frequencies. Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common engineering error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. Signal degradation by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an <a href="/wiki/Eye_pattern" title="Eye pattern">eye pattern</a>.\n</p>, <p>Moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water also may be soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren\'t too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuit board materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating, as during soldering, and cause cracking and delamination,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> the same effect responsible for "popcorning" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts.

One <a href="/wiki/Ounce" title="Ounce">ounce</a> per <a href="/wiki/Square_foot" title="Square foot">square foot</a> is 1.344 mils or 34 micrometers thickness. <i>Heavy copper</i> is a layer exceeding three ounces of copper per ft<sup>2</sup>, or approximately 0.0042 inches (4.2 mils, 105 \xce\xbcm) thick.  Heavy copper layers are used for high current or  to help dissipate heat.\n</p>, <p>On the common FR-4 substrates, 1 <a href="/wiki/Ounce" title="Ounce">oz</a> copper per ft<sup>2</sup> (35 \xc2\xb5m) is the most common thickness; 2 oz (70 \xc2\xb5m) and 0.5 oz (18 \xc2\xb5m) thickness is often an option. Less common are 12 and 105 \xc2\xb5m, 9 \xc2\xb5m is sometimes available on some substrates. Flexible substrates typically have thinner metalization. Metal-core boards for high power devices commonly use thicker copper; 35 \xc2\xb5m is usual but also 140 and 400 \xc2\xb5m can be encountered.\n</p>, <p>Safety Standard UL 796 covers component safety requirements for printed wiring boards for use as components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as flammability, maximum <a href="/wiki/Operating_temperature" title="Operating temperature">operating temperature</a>, electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.\n</p>, <p>Initially PCBs were designed manually by creating a <a href="/wiki/Photomask" title="Photomask">photomask</a> on a clear <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mylar" title="Mylar">mylar</a> sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on <a href="/wiki/Dry_transfer" title="Dry transfer">dry transfers</a> of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. The finished photomask was <a href="/wiki/Photolithography" title="Photolithography">photolithographically</a> reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.\n</p>, <p>Modern PCBs are designed with dedicated layout software, generally in the following steps:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><span id="pcbmanufac"></span>\n</p>, <p>PCB manufacturing consists of many steps.\n</p>, <p>Manufacturing starts from the fabrication data generated by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_aided_design" title="Computer aided design">computer aided design</a>, and component information. The  fabrication data is read into the CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software. CAM performs the following functions:\n</p>, <p>Several small printed circuit boards can be grouped together for processing as a panel. A panel consisting of a design duplicated <i>n</i>-times is also called an <i>n</i>-panel, whereas a <i>multi-panel</i> combines several different design onto a single panel. The outer tooling strip often includes <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Tooling_hole&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Tooling hole (page does not exist)">tooling holes</a>, a set of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Panel_fiducial" title="Panel fiducial">panel fiducials</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Test_coupon_(PCB)" title="Test coupon (PCB)">test coupon</a>, and may include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hatched_copper_pour" title="Hatched copper pour">hatched copper pour</a> or similar patterns for even copper distribution over the whole panel in order to avoid bending. The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient.\n</p>, <p>The panel is eventually broken into individual PCBs along perforations or grooves in the panel.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Today depaneling is often done by lasers which cut the board with no contact. Laser depaneling reduces stress on the fragile circuits, improving the yield of defect-free units.\n</p>, <p>The first step is to replicate the pattern in the fabricator\'s CAM system on a protective mask on the copper foil PCB layers.  Subsequent etching removes the unwanted copper. (Alternatively, a conductive ink can be ink-jetted on a blank (non-conductive) board. This technique is also used in the manufacture of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hybrid_circuit" title="Hybrid circuit">hybrid circuits</a>.)\n</p>, <p>The method chosen depends on the  number of boards to be produced and the required resolution.\n</p>, <p>Subtractive methods remove copper from an entirely copper-coated board to leave only the desired copper pattern.  In additive methods the pattern is <a href="/wiki/Electroplating" title="Electroplating">electroplated</a> onto a bare substrate using a complex process. The advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. In the full additive process the bare laminate is covered with a photosensitive film which is imaged (exposed to light through a mask and then developed which removes the unexposed film).  The exposed areas are sensitized in a chemical bath, usually containing palladium and similar to that used for through hole plating which makes the exposed area capable of bonding metal ions.  The laminate is then plated with copper in the sensitized areas.  When the mask is stripped, the PCB is finished.\n</p>, <p>Semi-additive is the most common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it. A reverse mask is then applied. (Unlike a subtractive process mask, this mask exposes those parts of the substrate that will eventually become the traces.) Additional copper is then plated onto the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to any desired weight. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief etching step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces.  Some single-sided boards which have plated-through holes are made in this way.  <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> made consumer radio sets in the late 1960s using additive boards.\n</p>, <p>The (semi-)additive process is commonly used for multi-layer boards as it facilitates the <a href="/wiki/Plating" title="Plating">plating</a>-through of the holes to produce conductive <a href="/wiki/Via_(electronics)" title="Via (electronics)">vias</a> in the circuit board.\n</p>, <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Industrial_etching" title="Industrial etching">Chemical etching</a> is usually done with <a href="/wiki/Ammonium_persulfate" title="Ammonium persulfate">ammonium persulfate</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ferric_chloride" title="Ferric chloride">ferric chloride</a>. For PTH (plated-through holes), additional steps of <a href="/wiki/Electroplating#Electroless_deposition" title="Electroplating">electroless deposition</a> are done after the holes are drilled, then copper is electroplated to build up the thickness, the boards are screened, and plated with tin/lead. The tin/lead becomes the resist leaving the bare copper to be etched away.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The simplest method, used for small-scale production and often by hobbyists, is immersion etching, in which the board is submerged in etching solution such as ferric chloride. Compared with methods used for mass production, the etching time is long.  Heat and agitation can be applied to the bath to speed the etching rate. In bubble etching, air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching. Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the etchant solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps. Adjustment of the nozzle pattern, flow rate, temperature, and etchant composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Khandpur05_31-0"><a href="#cite_note-Khandpur05-31">[31]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>As more copper is consumed from the boards, the etchant becomes saturated and less effective; different etchants have different capacities for copper, with some as high as 150 grams of copper per litre of solution. In commercial use, etchants can be regenerated to restore their activity, and the dissolved copper recovered and sold.  Small-scale etching requires attention to disposal of used etchant, which is corrosive and toxic due to its metal content.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The etchant removes copper on all surfaces not protected by the resist.  "Undercut" occurs when etchant attacks the thin edge of copper under the resist; this can reduce conductor widths and cause open-circuits. Careful control of etch time is required to prevent undercut.  Where metallic plating is used as a resist, it can "overhang" which can cause short-circuits between adjacent traces when closely spaced. Overhang can be removed by wire-brushing the board after etching.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Khandpur05_31-1"><a href="#cite_note-Khandpur05-31">[31]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Multi-layer printed circuit boards have trace layers inside the board. This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat for a period of time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The inner layers are given a complete machine inspection before lamination because afterwards mistakes cannot be corrected. The automatic optical inspection system compares an image of the board with the digital image generated from the original design data.\n</p>, <p>Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with <a href="/wiki/Drill_bit" title="Drill bit">drill bits</a> made of solid coated <a href="/wiki/Tungsten_carbide" title="Tungsten carbide">tungsten carbide</a>. Coated tungsten carbide is used because board materials are abrasive.  High-speed-steel bits would dull quickly, tearing the copper and ruining the board. Drilling is done by computer-controlled drilling machines, using a <i>drill file</i> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Excellon_file" title="Excellon file">Excellon file</a> that describes the location and size of each drilled hole.\n</p>, <p>Holes may be made conductive, by electroplating or inserting hollow metal eyelets, to connect board layers. Some conductive holes are intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others used to connect board layers, are called <a href="/wiki/Via_(electronics)" title="Via (electronics)">vias</a>.\n</p>, <p>When very small vias are required, drilling with mechanical bits is costly because of high rates of wear and breakage. In this case, the vias may be <a href="/wiki/Laser_drilling" title="Laser drilling">laser drilled</a>\xe2\x80\x94evaporated by <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">lasers</a>. Laser-drilled vias typically have an inferior surface finish inside the hole. These holes are called <i>micro vias</i>.  It is also possible with <i>controlled-depth</i> drilling, laser drilling, or by pre-drilling the individual sheets of the PCB before lamination, to produce holes that connect only some of the copper layers, rather than passing through the entire board. These holes are called <i>blind vias</i> when they connect an internal copper layer to an outer layer, or <i>buried vias</i> when they connect two or more internal copper layers and no outer layers.\n</p>, <p>The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form <i>plated-through holes</i>. These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a <i>smear</i> of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical <i>de-smear</i> process, or by <i>plasma-etch</i>. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.\n</p>, <p>Proper plating or surface finish selection can be critical to process yield, the amount of rework, field failure rate, and reliability.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>PCBs are plated with solder, tin, or gold over nickel and a resist for <a href="/wiki/Etching" title="Etching">etching</a> away the unneeded underlying copper.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-36"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>After PCBs are etched and then rinsed with water, the solder mask is applied, and then any exposed copper is coated with solder, nickel/gold, or some other anti-corrosion coating.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Matte solder is usually fused to provide a better bonding surface for bare copper.

The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hot_air_solder_levelling" title="Hot air solder levelling">hot air solder levelling</a> (HASL).

Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>5</sub> and Ag<sub>3</sub>Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.\n</p>, <p><i>Electrochemical migration</i> (ECM) is the growth of conductive metal filaments on or in a printed circuit board (PCB) under the influence of a DC voltage bias.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Silver, zinc, and aluminum are known to grow <a href="/wiki/Whisker_(metallurgy)" title="Whisker (metallurgy)">whiskers</a> under the influence of an electric field. Silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow "whiskers" due to tension in the plated surface. Tin-lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by reducing the percentage of tin. Reflow to melt solder or tin plate to relieve surface stress lowers whisker incidence. Another coating issue is <a href="/wiki/Tin_pest" title="Tin pest">tin pest</a>, the transformation of tin to a powdery  allotrope at low temperature.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Areas that should not be soldered may be covered with <a href="/wiki/Solder_mask" title="Solder mask">solder resist</a> (solder mask).

Dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching.  After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and developed as LPI.  Once but no longer commonly used, because of its low accuracy and resolution, is to screen print epoxy ink. In addition to repelling solder, solder resist also provides protection from the environment to the copper that would otherwise be exposed.\n</p>, <p>A legend is often printed on one or both sides of the PCB. It contains the <a href="/wiki/Reference_designator" title="Reference designator">component designators</a>, switch settings, test points and other indications helpful in assembling, testing, servicing, and sometimes using the circuit board.\n</p>, <p>There are three methods to print the legend.\n</p>, <p>Boards with no components installed are usually <i>bare-board tested</i> for "shorts" and "opens". A short is a connection between two points that should not be connected. An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected. For high-volume production, a fixture or a <a href="/wiki/Rigid_needle_adapter" title="Rigid needle adapter">rigid needle adapter</a> makes contact with copper lands on the board. The fixture or adapter is a significant fixed cost and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production <i><a href="/wiki/Flying_probe" title="Flying probe">flying probe</a></i> testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The CAM system <i>instructs</i> the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.\n</p>, <p>In assembly the bare board is populated (or "stuffed") with electronic components to form a functional <i>printed circuit assembly</i> (PCA), sometimes called a "printed circuit board assembly" (PCBA).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-43"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Through-hole_technology" title="Through-hole technology">through-hole technology</a>, the component leads are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive <i>pads</i>; the holes keep the components in place.

Some SMT parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as <a href="/wiki/Ball_grid_array" title="Ball grid array">BGA</a> packages. All through-hole components can be hand soldered, making them favored for prototyping where size, weight, and the use of the exact components that would be used in high volume production are not concerns.\n</p>, <p>Often, through-hole and surface-mount construction must be combined in a single assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. Or, even if all components are available in through-hole packages, it might be desired to take advantage of the size, weight, and cost reductions obtainable by using some available surface-mount devices. Another reason to use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress (such as connectors that are frequently mated and demated or that connect to cables expected to impart substantial stress to the PCB-and-connector interface), while components that are expected to go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques. <i>For further comparison, see the <a href="/wiki/Surface-mount_technology#Advantages" title="Surface-mount technology">SMT page</a>.</i>\n</p>, <p>After the board has been populated it may be tested in a variety of ways:\n</p>, <p>To facilitate these tests, PCBs may be designed with extra pads to make temporary connections. Sometimes these pads must be isolated with resistors. The in-circuit test may also exercise <a href="/wiki/Boundary_scan" title="Boundary scan">boundary scan</a> test features of some components. In-circuit test systems may also be used to program nonvolatile memory components on the board.\n</p>, <p>In boundary scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs on the board form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group (<a href="/wiki/JTAG" title="JTAG">JTAG</a>) standard. The <a href="/wiki/JTAG" title="JTAG">JTAG</a> test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes, by using circuitry in the ICs to employ the IC pins themselves as test probes. <a href="/wiki/JTAG" title="JTAG">JTAG</a> tool vendors provide various types of stimuli and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.\n</p>, <p>When boards fail the test, technicians may <a href="/wiki/Desoldering" title="Desoldering">desolder</a> and replace failed components, a task known as <i><a href="/wiki/Rework_(electronics)" title="Rework (electronics)">rework</a></i>.\n</p>, <p>PCBs intended for extreme environments often have a <a href="/wiki/Conformal_coating" title="Conformal coating">conformal coating</a>, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were <a href="/wiki/Wax" title="Wax">wax</a>; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be <a href="/wiki/Sputter_deposition" title="Sputter deposition">sputtered</a> onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Many assembled PCBs are <a href="/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge" title="Electrostatic discharge">static</a> sensitive, and therefore they must be placed in <a href="/wiki/Antistatic_bag" title="Antistatic bag">antistatic bags</a> during transport.

Improper handling techniques might transmit an accumulated static charge through the board, damaging or destroying components. The damage might not immediately affect function but might lead to early failure later on, cause intermittent operating faults, or cause a narrowing of the range of environmental and electrical conditions under which the board functions properly. Even bare boards are sometimes static sensitive: traces have become so fine that it\'s quite possible to blow an etch off the board (or change its characteristics) with a static charge. This is especially true on non-traditional PCBs such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multi-Chip_Module" title="Multi-Chip Module">MCMs</a> and microwave PCBs.\n</p>, <p>Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with <a href="/wiki/Through-hole_technology" title="Through-hole technology">wire-ended components</a> in applications where space was at a premium (such as <a href="/wiki/Fuze" title="Fuze">fuzes</a>, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-46"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special <a href="/wiki/Nickel" title="Nickel">nickel</a>-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause mechanical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.\n</p>, <p>Before the advent of <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a>, this method allowed the highest possible component packing density; because of this, it was used by a number of computer vendors including <a href="/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation" title="Control Data Corporation">Control Data Corporation</a>. The cordwood method of construction was used only rarely once semiconductor electronics and PCBs became widespread.\n</p>, <p>Multiwire is a patented technique of interconnection which uses machine-routed insulated wires embedded in a non-conducting matrix (often plastic resin).
