[<p><b>Computer graphics</b> are pictures and films created using computers. Usually, the term refers to computer-generated image data created with the help of specialized graphical hardware and software. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960, by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n</p>, <p>Some topics in computer graphics include <a href="/wiki/User_interface_design" title="User interface design">user interface design</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sprite_(graphics)" title="Sprite (graphics)">sprite graphics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics">vector graphics</a>, <a href="/wiki/3D_modeling" title="3D modeling">3D modeling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shader" title="Shader">shaders</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GPU" title="GPU">GPU</a> design, <a href="/wiki/Implicit_surface" title="Implicit surface">implicit surface</a> visualization with <a href="/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)" title="Ray tracing (graphics)">ray tracing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Computer_vision" title="Computer vision">computer vision</a>, among others.

Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-<a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> period \xe2\x80\x93 during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure <a href="/wiki/University" title="University">university</a> and <a href="/wiki/Laboratory" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> academic research into more advanced computers and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_military" title="United States military">United States military</a>\'s further development of technologies like <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a>, advanced <a href="/wiki/Aviation" title="Aviation">aviation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rocket" title="Rocket">rocketry</a> developed during the war.

This began the decades-long transformation of the southern <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area" title="San Francisco Bay Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a> into the world\'s leading computer technology hub - now known as <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>. The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware.\n</p>, <p>Further advances in computing led to greater advancements in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Interactive_computer_graphics" title="Interactive computer graphics">interactive computer graphics</a>. In 1959, the <a href="/wiki/TX-2" title="TX-2">TX-2</a> computer was developed at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lincoln_Laboratory" title="Lincoln Laboratory">MIT\'s Lincoln Laboratory</a>. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A <a href="/wiki/Light_pen" title="Light pen">light pen</a> could be used to draw sketches on the computer using <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland" title="Ivan Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a>\'s revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Sketchpad" title="Sketchpad">Sketchpad software</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-WC03_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-WC03-5">[5]</a></sup> Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photoelectric_cell" title="Photoelectric cell">photoelectric cell</a> in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen\'s <a href="/wiki/Electron_gun" title="Electron gun">electron gun</a> fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland\'s software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.\n</p>, <p>The phrase "computer graphics" itself was coined in 1960 by <a href="/wiki/William_Fetter" title="William Fetter">William Fetter</a>, a graphic designer for <a href="/wiki/Boeing" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-WC03_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-WC03-5">[5]</a></sup> This old quote in many secondary sources comes complete with the following sentence:\n</p>, <p>In 1961 another student at MIT, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Russell_(computer_scientist)" title="Steve Russell (computer scientist)">Steve Russell</a>, created another important title in the history of <a href="/wiki/Video_game" title="Video game">video games</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Spacewar!" title="Spacewar!">Spacewar!</a></i>.

The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the "world\'s first video game" for their new customers. (Higginbotham\'s <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tennis_For_Two" title="Tennis For Two">Tennis For Two</a></i> had beaten <i>Spacewar</i> by almost three years; but it was almost unknown outside of a research or academic setting.)\n</p>, <p>E.

Zajac, a scientist at <a href="/wiki/Bell_Labs" title="Bell Labs">Bell Telephone Laboratory</a> (BTL), created a film called "Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system" in 1963.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an <a href="/wiki/IBM_7090" title="IBM 7090">IBM 7090</a> mainframe computer.

These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves - unlike polygons - are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well.\n</p>, <p>It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. <a href="/wiki/TRW_Inc." title="TRW Inc.">TRW</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation" title="Lockheed Corporation">Lockheed-Georgia</a>, <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sperry_Rand" title="Sperry Rand">Sperry Rand</a> are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the <a href="/wiki/IBM_2250" title="IBM 2250">IBM 2250</a> graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ralph_Baer" title="Ralph Baer">Ralph Baer</a>, a supervising engineer at <a href="/wiki/Sanders_Associates" title="Sanders Associates">Sanders Associates</a>, came up with a home <a href="/wiki/Video_game" title="Video game">video game</a> in 1966 that was later licensed to <a href="/wiki/Magnavox" title="Magnavox">Magnavox</a> and called the <a href="/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey" title="Magnavox Odyssey">Odyssey</a>. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. <a href="/wiki/David_C._Evans" title="David C. Evans">David C. Evans</a> was director of engineering at <a href="/wiki/Bendix_Corporation" title="Bendix Corporation">Bendix Corporation</a>\'s computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Utah" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world\'s primary research center for computer graphics.\n</p>, <p>Also in 1966, <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland" title="Ivan Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a> continued to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled <a href="/wiki/Head-mounted_display" title="Head-mounted display">head-mounted display</a> (HMD). Called the Sword of Damocles because of the hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stereoscopic_3D" title="Stereoscopic 3D">stereoscopic 3D</a>. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">ARPA</a> (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Utah" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> - a development which would turn that department into one of the most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their <a href="/wiki/Virtual_reality" title="Virtual reality">virtual reality</a> research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.\n</p>, <p>In 1968, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Appel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Arthur Appel (page does not exist)">Arthur Appel</a> described the first algorithm for what would eventually become known as <a href="/wiki/Ray_casting" title="Ray casting">ray casting</a> - a basis point for almost all of modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/3D_graphics" title="3D graphics">3D graphics</a>, as well as the later pursuit of <a href="/wiki/Photorealism" title="Photorealism">photorealism</a> in graphics.\n</p>, <p>In 1969, the <a href="/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery" title="Association for Computing Machinery">ACM</a> initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics (<a href="/wiki/SIGGRAPH" title="SIGGRAPH">SIGGRAPH</a>) which organizes <a href="/wiki/List_of_computer_science_conferences#Computer_graphics" title="List of computer science conferences">conferences</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Graphics_standards" title="Graphics standards">graphics standards</a>, and publications within the field of computer graphics. By 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.\n</p>, <p>An astonishing amount of the breakthroughs in the field in this decade - particularly many important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic - occurred at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Utah" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> in the 1970s, which had hired <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland" title="Ivan Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a>. Sutherland was paired with <a href="/wiki/David_C._Evans" title="David C. Evans">David C.

Growing up on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disney" title="Disney">Disney</a>, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered <a href="/wiki/Texture_mapping" title="Texture mapping">texture mapping</a> to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in <a href="/wiki/3D_modeling" title="3D modeling">3D modeling</a>.

In the same class, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fred_Parke" title="Fred Parke">Fred Parke</a> created an animation of his wife\'s face.\n</p>, <p>As the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, <a href="/wiki/John_Warnock" title="John Warnock">John Warnock</a> was another of those early pioneers; he would later found <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Adobe_Systems" title="Adobe Systems">Adobe Systems</a> and create a revolution in the publishing world with his <a href="/wiki/PostScript" title="PostScript">PostScript</a> page description language, and Adobe would go on later to create the industry standard <a href="/wiki/Image_editing" title="Image editing">photo editing</a> software in <a href="/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop" title="Adobe Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a> and a prominent movie industry <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Special_effects" title="Special effects">special effects</a> program in <a href="/wiki/Adobe_After_Effects" title="Adobe After Effects">Adobe After Effects</a>. <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Tom_Stockham&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Tom Stockham (page does not exist)">Tom Stockham</a> led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. <a href="/wiki/James_H._Clark" title="James H.

In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are "behind" the object from the viewer\'s perspective, and thus should be "hidden" when the computer creates (or renders) the image.

Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mini-computers" title="Mini-computers">mini-computers</a>. Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from <a href="/wiki/Bell-Northern_Research" title="Bell-Northern Research">Bell-Northern Research</a>, and led by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/David_Pearson,_Computer_Scientist" title="David Pearson, Computer Scientist">David Pearson</a>, an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector.

The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interfaces" title="Graphical user interfaces">graphical user interfaces</a> (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text.

This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing.\n</p>, <p>Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.\n</p>, <p>3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models. The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering. However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object. Until visually displayed a model is not graphic. Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space. 3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. Also can be used in non-graphical <a href="/wiki/Computer_simulation" title="Computer simulation">computer simulations</a> and calculations.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Computer_animation" title="Computer animation">Computer animation</a> is the art of creating moving images via the use of <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>. It is a subfield of computer graphics and <a href="/wiki/Animation" title="Animation">animation</a>. Increasingly it is created by means of <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" title="3D computer graphics">3D computer graphics</a>, though <a href="/wiki/2D_computer_graphics" title="2D computer graphics">2D computer graphics</a> are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Real-time_rendering" title="Real-time rendering">real-time rendering</a> needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Recording_medium" title="Recording medium">medium</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Film" title="Film">film</a>. It is also referred to as CGI (<a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">Computer-generated imagery</a> or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.\n</p>, <p>Virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object\'s <a href="/wiki/Transformation_matrix" title="Transformation matrix">transformation matrix</a>. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keyframe" title="Keyframe">keyframes</a>, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include <a href="/wiki/Procedural_animation" title="Procedural animation">procedural</a> and <a href="/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)" title="Expression (mathematics)">expression</a>-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating <a href="/wiki/Particle_system" title="Particle system">particle</a> effects and <a href="/wiki/Crowd_simulation" title="Crowd simulation">crowd simulations</a>; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a> offers in <a href="/wiki/Skeletal_animation" title="Skeletal animation">skeletal system</a> set up).\n</p>, <p>To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_display" title="Computer display">screen</a> then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in <a href="/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a> and <a href="/wiki/Film" title="Film">motion pictures</a>.\n</p>, <p>Images are typically created by devices such as <a href="/wiki/Camera" title="Camera">cameras</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mirror" title="Mirror">mirrors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lens_(optics)" title="Lens (optics)">lenses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telescope" title="Telescope">telescopes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Microscope" title="Microscope">microscopes</a>, etc.\n</p>, <p>Digital images include both <a href="/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics">vector</a> images and <a href="/wiki/Raster_graphics" title="Raster graphics">raster</a> images, but raster images are more commonly used.\n</p>, <p>In digital imaging, a <a href="/wiki/Pixel" title="Pixel">pixel</a> (or picture element<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>) is a single point in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Raster_image" title="Raster image">raster image</a>. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sample_(signal)" title="Sample (signal)">sample</a> of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The <a href="/wiki/Intensity_(physics)" title="Intensity (physics)">intensity</a> of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three\ncomponents such as <a href="/wiki/RGB_color_model" title="RGB color model">red, green, and blue</a>.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Graphics" title="Graphics">Graphics</a> are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Visual" title="Visual">visual</a> presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen. Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, <a href="/wiki/Map" title="Map">maps</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Engineering_drawings" title="Engineering drawings">engineering drawings</a>, or other images. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.\n</p>, <p>Primitives are basic units which a graphics system may combine to create more complex images or models.

A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, <a href="/wiki/Texture_mapping" title="Texture mapping">texture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lighting" title="Lighting">lighting</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Shading" title="Shading">shading</a> information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a <a href="/wiki/Digital_image" title="Digital image">digital image</a> or <a href="/wiki/Raster_graphics" title="Raster graphics">raster graphics</a> image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term "rendering" may be by analogy with an "artist\'s rendering" of a scene. Although the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the <a href="/wiki/Graphics_pipeline" title="Graphics pipeline">graphics pipeline</a> along a rendering device, such as a <a href="/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" title="Graphics processing unit">GPU</a>. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the <a href="/wiki/Rendering_equation" title="Rendering equation">rendering equation</a>. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. \'Rendering\' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Volume_rendering" title="Volume rendering">Volume rendering</a> is a technique used to display a <a href="/wiki/3D_projection" title="3D projection">2D projection</a> of a 3D discretely <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)" title="Sampling (signal processing)">sampled</a> <a href="/wiki/Data_set" title="Data set">data set</a>. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computed_axial_tomography" title="Computed axial tomography">CT</a> or <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="Magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</a> scanner.\n</p>, <p>Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image <a href="/wiki/Pixel" title="Pixel">pixels</a> in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or <a href="/wiki/Voxel" title="Voxel">voxel</a> represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n</p>, <p>3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wire_frame_model" title="Wire frame model">wireframe</a> representation of any three-dimensional object, called a "3D model", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to <a href="/wiki/Plastic_arts" title="Plastic arts">plastic arts</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sculpting" title="Sculpting">sculpting</a>. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, <a href="/wiki/Polygonal_modeling" title="Polygonal modeling">polygonal mesh modeling</a> (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh <a href="/wiki/Subdivision_surface" title="Subdivision surface">subdivision</a> (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models).
