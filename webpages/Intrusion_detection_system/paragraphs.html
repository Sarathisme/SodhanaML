[<p>An <b>intrusion detection system</b> (<b>IDS</b>) is a device or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Software_application" title="Software application">software application</a> that monitors a <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a> or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a <a href="/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management" title="Security information and event management">security information and event management</a> (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses <a href="/wiki/Alarm_filtering" title="Alarm filtering">alarm filtering</a> techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as <a href="/wiki/Malware" title="Malware">malware</a>); and <a href="/wiki/Anomaly-based_intrusion_detection_system" title="Anomaly-based intrusion detection system">anomaly-based detection</a> (detecting deviations from a model of "good" traffic, which often relies on <a href="/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine learning">machine learning</a>). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an <b>intrusion prevention system</b>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system.  This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying <a href="/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)" title="Heuristic (computer science)">heuristics</a> and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators.  A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system, and is another form of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Application_layer_firewall" title="Application layer firewall">application layer firewall</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire <a href="/wiki/Subnetwork" title="Subnetwork">subnet</a>, and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behavior is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator. An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall. Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network. <a href="/wiki/OPNET" title="OPNET">OPNET</a> and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems. NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS.\nWhen we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property, there are two types: on-line and off-line NIDS, often referred to as inline and tap mode, respectively. On-line NIDS deals with the network in real time. It analyses the <a href="/wiki/Ethernet_frame" title="Ethernet frame">Ethernet packets</a> and applies some rules, to decide if it is an attack or not. Off-line NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not.\n</p>, <p>NIDS can also combined with other technologies to increase detection, and prediction, rates. <a href="/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" title="Artificial neural network">Artificial Neural Network</a> based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data, in a smart way, due to the self-organizing structure that allows INS IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>. Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes; INN IDS help develop an early warning system, based on two layers. The first layer accepts single values, while the second layer takes the first\'s layers output as input; the cycle repeats and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen patterns in the network<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>. This system can average 99.9% detection and classification rate, based on research results of 24 network attacks, divided in four categories: DOS, Probe, Remote-to-Local, and user-to-root.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected. It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot. If the critical system files were modified or deleted, an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate. An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines, which are not expected to change their configurations.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this model. Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it may suffer from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/False_positives" title="False positives">false positives</a>: previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious. Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the time-consuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs.

Gartner has noted that some organizations have opted for NTA over more traditional IDS.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts.  In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-nist80094_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-nist80094-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>IDPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack\'s content.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-nist80094_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-nist80094-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><b>Intrusion prevention systems</b> (<b>IPS</b>), also known as <b>intrusion detection and prevention systems</b> (<b>IDPS</b>), are <a href="/wiki/Network_security" title="Network security">network security</a> appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity.
