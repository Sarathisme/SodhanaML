[<p>In <a href="/wiki/Programming_language_theory" title="Programming language theory">programming language theory</a>, <b>semantics</b> is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of <a href="/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming languages</a>. It does so by evaluating the meaning of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Programming_language_syntax" title="Programming language syntax">syntactically</a> valid <a href="/wiki/String_(computer_science)" title="String (computer science)">strings</a> defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_platform" title="Computer platform">platform</a>, hence creating a <a href="/wiki/Model_of_computation" title="Model of computation">model of computation</a>.\n</p>, <p>Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing and to <i>prove</i>, e.g., that the following <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/If_statement" title="If statement">if statement</a> \n</p>, <p>has the same effect as <i>S1</i> alone.\n</p>, <p>The field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following:\n</p>, <p>It has close links with other areas of <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Programming_language_design" title="Programming language design">programming language design</a>, <a href="/wiki/Type_theory" title="Type theory">type theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compilers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)" title="Interpreter (computing)">interpreters</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Program_verification" title="Program verification">program verification</a> and <a href="/wiki/Model_checking" title="Model checking">model checking</a>.\n</p>, <p>There are many approaches to formal semantics; these belong to three major classes:\n</p>, <p>The distinctions between the three broad classes of approaches can sometimes be vague, but all known approaches to formal semantics use the above techniques, or some combination thereof.\n</p>, <p>Apart from the choice between denotational, operational, or axiomatic approaches, most variation in formal semantic systems arises from the choice of supporting mathematical formalism.\n</p>, <p>Some variations of formal semantics include the following:\n</p>, <p>For a variety of reasons, one might wish to describe the relationships between different formal semantics.
