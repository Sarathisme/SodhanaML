[<p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>, <p>An <b>integrated circuit</b> or <b>monolithic integrated circuit</b> (also referred to as an <b>IC</b>, a <b>chip</b>, or a <b>microchip</b>) is a set of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_circuit" title="Electronic circuit">electronic circuits</a> on one small flat piece (or "chip") of <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> material, normally <a href="/wiki/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a>.  The integration of large numbers of tiny <a href="/wiki/Transistor" title="Transistor">transistors</a> into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper, and faster than those constructed of discrete <a href="/wiki/Electronic_component" title="Electronic component">electronic components</a>. The IC\'s <a href="/wiki/Mass_production" title="Mass production">mass production</a> capability, reliability and building-block approach to <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit_design" title="Integrated circuit design">circuit design</a> has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors.  ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a>. <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">Computers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, and other digital <a href="/wiki/Home_appliance" title="Home appliance">home appliances</a> are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs.\n</p>, <p>Integrated circuits were made practical by mid-20th-century technology advancements in <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication" title="Semiconductor device fabrication">semiconductor device fabrication</a>.  Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more transistors on chips of the same size \xe2\x80\x93 a modern chip may have many billions of <a href="/wiki/Transistor" title="Transistor">transistors</a> in an area the size of a human fingernail.  These advances, roughly following <a href="/wiki/Moore%27s_law" title="Moore's law">Moore\'s law</a>, make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.\n</p>, <p>ICs have two main advantages over <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Discrete_circuit" title="Discrete circuit">discrete circuits</a>: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by <a href="/wiki/Photolithography" title="Photolithography">photolithography</a> rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC\'s components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and close proximity.  The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit_design" title="Integrated circuit design">design</a> them and <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication" title="Semiconductor device fabrication">fabricate</a> the required <a href="/wiki/Photomask" title="Photomask">photomasks</a>.
