[<p><b>Enterprise software</b>, also known as <b>enterprise application software</b> (<b>EAS</b>), is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_software" title="Computer software">computer software</a> used to satisfy the needs of an <a href="/wiki/Organization" title="Organization">organization</a> rather than individual users. Such organizations include businesses, schools, interest-based user groups, clubs, charities, and governments. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer-based) <a href="/wiki/Information_system" title="Information system">information system</a>.\n</p>, <p>Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools, such as online shopping, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Online_payment" title="Online payment">online payment</a> processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, <a href="/wiki/Business_process_management" title="Business process management">Business Process Management</a>,  <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_content_management" title="Enterprise content management">enterprise content management</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/IT_Service_Management" title="IT Service Management">IT Service Management</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" title="Customer relationship management">customer relationship management</a>, <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning" title="Enterprise resource planning">enterprise resource planning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Business_intelligence" title="Business intelligence">business intelligence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Project_management" title="Project management">project management</a>, <a href="/wiki/Collaboration" title="Collaboration">collaboration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Human_resource_management" title="Human resource management">human resource management</a>, manufacturing, <a href="/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health" title="Occupational safety and health">occupational health and safety</a>, <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration" title="Enterprise application integration">enterprise application integration</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_forms_automation" title="Enterprise forms automation">enterprise forms automation</a>.\n</p>, <p>As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge. Enterprise computing is a term that refers to information technology (IT) tools that businesses use for efficient production operations and back office support.  These IT tools cover database management, customer relationship management, supply chain management,  business process management and so on.\n</p>, <p>Enterprise Software describes a collection of computer programs with common business applications, tools for modeling how the entire organization works, and development tools for building applications unique to the organization.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise\'s productivity and efficiency by providing <a href="/wiki/Business_logic" title="Business logic">business logic</a> support functionality.\n</p>, <p>According to <a href="/wiki/Martin_Fowler" title="Martin Fowler">Martin Fowler</a>, "Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Business_processes" title="Business processes">business processes</a> with that data."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Although there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> they generally include <a href="/wiki/Software_performance_testing" title="Software performance testing">performance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scalability" title="Scalability">scalability</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science)" title="Robustness (computer science)">robustness</a>. Furthermore, enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for example <a href="/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol" title="Lightweight Directory Access Protocol">LDAP</a> to <a href="/wiki/Directory_service" title="Directory service">directory services</a>) and is centrally managed (a single admin page, for example).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Enterprise <a href="/wiki/Application_software" title="Application software">application software</a> performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user\'s personal computer and serves only one user at a time.\n</p>, <p>Enterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of enterprise application can be considered a "system" due to the integration with a firm\'s business processes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For example, IBM\'s Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Nevertheless, certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown below :\n</p>]
