[<p>A <b>word processor</b> is a computer program or device that provides for input, editing, formatting and output of text, often plus other features. \n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Word_processor_(electronic_device)" title="Word processor (electronic device)">Early word processors</a> were stand-alone devices dedicated to the function, but current word processors are <a href="/wiki/Word_processor_program" title="Word processor program">word processor programs</a> running on general purpose computers.\n</p>, <p>The functions of a word processor program fall somewhere between those of a simple <a href="/wiki/Text_editor" title="Text editor">text editor</a> and a fully functioned <a href="/wiki/Desktop_publishing" title="Desktop publishing">desktop publishing</a> program. However the distinctions between these three have changed over time, and are somewhat unclear.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>From the outset, it should be noted that \xe2\x80\x9cword processors\xe2\x80\x9d did not develop out of computer technology. Rather they evolved from the needs of writers not mathemeticians; only later did they merge with the computer field<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>. The history of word processing is the story of the gradual automation of the physical aspects of writing and editing, and then to the refinement of the technology to make it available to corporations and Individuals.\n</p>, <p>Word processing burst into American offices in early 1970s as an idea about reorganizing typists, but its meaning soon shifted to describe automated text editing. At first the designers of word processing systems combined existing with emerging technologies to develop stand-alone equipment, creating a new business quite separate from the emerging world of the personal computer.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cword processing\xe2\x80\x9d arose from the more general data processing, which since the 1950s had been the standard term used to describe the application of computers to business administration<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>.\n</p>, <p>Through history, there have been 3 types of word processors: mechanical, electronic and software.\n</p>, <p>The first word processing device (a "Machine for Transcribing Letters" that appears to have been similar to a typewriter) was patented by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Mill" title="Henry Mill">Henry Mill</a> for a machine that was capable of "writing so clearly and accurately you could not distinguish it from a printing press".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>More than a century later, another patent appeared in the name of <a href="/wiki/William_Austin_Burt" title="William Austin Burt">William Austin Burt</a> called the \xe2\x80\x9cTypographer\xe2\x80\x9d.\nIn the late 19th century, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Latham_Sholes" title="Christopher Latham Sholes">Christopher Latham Sholes</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> created the first recognizable typewriter that although it was a large size, which was described as a \xe2\x80\x9cliterary piano\xe2\x80\x9d<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>.\n</p>, <p>These mechanical systems could not \xe2\x80\x9cprocess text\xe2\x80\x9d beyond changing the position of type, re-fill empty spaces or jump lines. It was not until decades later that the introduction of electricity and then electronics into typewriters began to help the writer with the mechanical part.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cword processing\xe2\x80\x9d itself was created in the 1950s by <a href="/wiki/Ulrich_Steinhilper" title="Ulrich Steinhilper">Ulrich Steinhilper</a>, a German IBM typewriter sales executive.  However, it did not make its appearance in 1960s office management or computing literatures, though many of the ideas, products, and technologies to which it would later be applied were already well known. But by 1971 the term was recognized by the New York Times<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> as a business "buzz word", referred to "the brave new world of Word Processing or W/P. That\'s International Business Machines talk..."  Word processing paralleled the more general \xe2\x80\x9cdata processing\xe2\x80\x9d, which since the 1950s had been the standard term used to describe the application of computers to business administration.\n</p>, <p>Thus by 1972 discussion of word processing was common in publications devoted to office management and technology, and by the mid-1970s the term would have been familiar to any manager who regularly consulted general interest business periodicals.\n</p>]
