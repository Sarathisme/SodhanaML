These operating systems are most commonly found on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Webserver" title="Webserver">webservers</a>, although they can also function as a personal computer OS. The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD, as many of the protocols now commonly used by computers to connect, send and receive data over a network were widely implemented and refined in BSD. The <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called <a href="/wiki/NeXTSTEP" title="NeXTSTEP">NeXTSTEP</a>.\n</p>, <p>In 1974, <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> installed its first Unix system. Over time, students and staff in the computer science department there began adding new programs to make things easier, such as text editors. When Berkeley received new <a href="/wiki/VAX" title="VAX">VAX</a> computers in 1978 with Unix installed, the school\'s undergraduates modified Unix even more in order to take advantage of the computer\'s hardware possibilities.

Once this was done, however, AT&amp;T sued. After two years of legal disputes, the BSD project spawned a number of free derivatives, such as <a href="/wiki/NetBSD" title="NetBSD">NetBSD</a> and <a href="/wiki/FreeBSD" title="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> (both in 1993), and <a href="/wiki/OpenBSD" title="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> (from NetBSD in 1995).\n</p>, <p><b>macOS</b> (formerly "Mac OS X" and later "OS X")  is a line of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_core" title="Open core">open core</a> graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>, the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping <a href="/wiki/Macintosh" title="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers. macOS is the successor to the original <a href="/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS" title="Classic Mac OS">classic Mac OS</a>, which had been Apple\'s primary operating system since 1984.

All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware, whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component.\n</p>, <p>With the aid of the <a href="/wiki/Firmware" title="Firmware">firmware</a> and <a href="/wiki/Device_driver" title="Device driver">device drivers</a>, the kernel provides the most basic level of control over all of the computer\'s hardware devices. It manages memory access for programs in the <a href="/wiki/Random-access_memory" title="Random-access memory">RAM</a>, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources, it sets up or resets the CPU\'s operating states for optimal operation at all times, and it organizes the data for long-term <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-volatile_storage" title="Non-volatile storage">non-volatile storage</a> with <a href="/wiki/File_system" title="File system">file systems</a> on such media as disks, tapes, flash memory, etc.\n</p>, <p>The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating system.  The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs. Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Interrupt" title="Interrupt">Interrupts</a> are central to operating systems, as they provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact with and react to its environment.  The alternative –  having the operating system "watch" the various sources of input for events (polling) that require action –  can be found in older systems with very small <a href="/wiki/Call_stack" title="Call stack">stacks</a> (50 or 60 bytes) but is unusual in modern systems with large stacks. <a href="/wiki/Interrupt" title="Interrupt">Interrupt</a>-based programming is directly supported by most modern CPUs. Interrupts provide a computer with a way of automatically saving local register contexts, and running specific code in response to events. Even very basic computers support hardware interrupts, and allow the programmer to specify code which may be run when that event takes place.\n</p>, <p>When an interrupt is received, the computer\'s hardware automatically suspends whatever program is currently running, saves its status, and runs computer code previously associated with the interrupt; this is analogous to placing a bookmark in a book in response to a phone call.  In modern operating systems, interrupts are handled by the operating system\'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a>. Interrupts may come from either the computer\'s hardware or the running program.\n</p>, <p>When a hardware device triggers an interrupt, the operating system\'s kernel decides how to deal with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Device_drivers" title="Device drivers">device driver</a>, which may be part of the operating system\'s kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.\n</p>, <p>A program may also trigger an interrupt to the operating system. If a program wishes to access hardware, for example, it may interrupt the operating system\'s kernel, which causes control to be passed back to the kernel. The kernel then processes the request.  If a program wishes additional resources (or wishes to shed resources) such as memory, it triggers an interrupt to get the kernel\'s attention.\n</p>, <p>Modern <a href="/wiki/Microprocessor" title="Microprocessor">microprocessors</a> (CPU or MPU) support multiple modes of operation. CPUs with this capability offer at least two modes: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/User_mode" title="User mode">user mode</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supervisor_mode" title="Supervisor mode">supervisor mode</a>. In general terms, supervisor mode operation allows unrestricted access to all machine resources, including all MPU instructions.  User mode operation sets limits on instruction use and typically disallows direct access to machine resources. CPUs might have other modes similar to user mode as well, such as the virtual modes in order to emulate older processor types, such as 16-bit processors on a 32-bit one, or 32-bit processors on a <a href="/wiki/64-bit_computing" title="64-bit computing">64-bit</a> one.\n</p>, <p>At power-on or reset, the system begins in supervisor mode. Once an operating system <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> has been loaded and started, the boundary between user mode and supervisor mode (also known as kernel mode) can be established.\n</p>, <p>Supervisor mode is used by the kernel for low level tasks that need unrestricted access to hardware, such as controlling how memory is accessed, and communicating with devices such as disk drives and video display devices. User mode, in contrast, is used for almost everything else. Application programs, such as word processors and database managers, operate within user mode, and can only access machine resources by turning control over to the kernel, a process which causes a switch to supervisor mode.  Typically, the transfer of control to the kernel is achieved by executing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Software_interrupt" title="Software interrupt">software interrupt</a> instruction, such as the Motorola 68000 <code>TRAP</code> instruction.  The software interrupt causes the microprocessor to switch from user mode to supervisor mode and begin executing code that allows the kernel to take control.\n</p>, <p>In user mode, programs usually have access to a restricted set of microprocessor instructions, and generally cannot execute any instructions that could potentially cause disruption to the system\'s operation.  In supervisor mode, instruction execution restrictions are typically removed, allowing the kernel unrestricted access to all machine resources.\n</p>, <p>The term "user mode resource" generally refers to one or more CPU registers, which contain information that the running program isn\'t allowed to alter. Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to supervisor mode, where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting, for example, by forcibly terminating ("killing") the program).\n</p>, <p>Among other things, a multiprogramming operating system <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs. This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program. Since programs time share, each program must have independent access to memory.\n</p>, <p>Cooperative memory management, used by many early operating systems, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a>\'s memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory. This system of memory management is almost never seen any more, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory. If a program fails, it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten. Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program\'s memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself. With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Memory_protection" title="Memory protection">Memory protection</a> enables the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> to limit a process\' access to the computer\'s memory. Various methods of memory protection exist, including <a href="/wiki/Memory_segmentation" title="Memory segmentation">memory segmentation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paging" title="Paging">paging</a>. All methods require some level of hardware support (such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/80286" title="80286">80286</a> MMU), which doesn\'t exist in all computers.\n</p>, <p>In both segmentation and paging, certain <a href="/wiki/Protected_mode" title="Protected mode">protected mode</a> registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an interrupt which cause the CPU to re-enter <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supervisor_mode" title="Supervisor mode">supervisor mode</a>, placing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> in charge. This is called a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Segmentation_violation" title="Segmentation violation">segmentation violation</a> or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> generally resorts to terminating the offending program, and reports the error.\n</p>, <p>Windows versions 3.1 through ME had some level of memory protection, but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it. A <a href="/wiki/General_protection_fault" title="General protection fault">general protection fault</a> would be produced, indicating a segmentation violation had occurred; however, the system would often crash anyway.\n</p>, <p>The use of virtual memory addressing (such as paging or segmentation) means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time, allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks.\n</p>, <p>If a program tries to access memory that isn\'t in its current range of accessible memory, but nonetheless has been allocated to it, the kernel is interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memory. (See section on memory management.) Under UNIX this kind of interrupt is referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Page_fault" title="Page fault">page fault</a>.\n</p>, <p>When the kernel detects a page fault it generally adjusts the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it, granting it access to the memory requested. This gives the kernel discretionary power over where a particular application\'s memory is stored, or even whether or not it has actually been allocated yet.\n</p>, <p>In modern operating systems, memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to make that space available for use by other programs. This is called <a href="/wiki/Paging" title="Paging">swapping</a>, as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs, and what that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on demand.\n</p>, <p>"Virtual memory" provides the programmer or the user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the computer than is really there.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Operating_System_31-0"><a href="#cite_note-Operating_System-31">[31]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Computer_multitasking" title="Computer multitasking">Multitasking</a> refers to the running of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer; giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same time. Since most computers can do at most one or two things at one time, this is generally done via time-sharing, which means that each program uses a share of the computer\'s time to execute.\n</p>, <p>An operating system <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a> contains a <a href="/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)" title="Scheduling (computing)">scheduling</a> program which determines how much time each process spends executing, and in which order execution control should be passed to programs. Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the program access to the <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a> and memory. Later, control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism, so that another program may be allowed to use the CPU. This so-called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a <a href="/wiki/Context_switch" title="Context switch">context switch</a>.\n</p>, <p>An early model which governed the allocation of time to programs was called <a href="/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking" title="Cooperative multitasking">cooperative multitasking</a>. In this model, when control is passed to a program by the kernel, it may execute for as long as it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel. This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU, but it can hang the entire system if it enters an <a href="/wiki/Infinite_loop" title="Infinite loop">infinite loop</a>.\n</p>, <p>Modern operating systems extend the concepts of application preemption to device drivers and kernel code, so that the operating system has preemptive control over internal run-times as well.\n</p>, <p>The philosophy governing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Preemptive_multitasking" title="Preemptive multitasking">preemptive multitasking</a> is that of ensuring that all programs are given regular time on the CPU. This implies that all programs must be limited in how much time they are allowed to spend on the CPU without being interrupted. To accomplish this, modern operating system kernels make use of a timed interrupt. A <a href="/wiki/Protected_mode" title="Protected mode">protected mode</a> timer is set by the kernel which triggers a return to supervisor mode after the specified time has elapsed. (See above sections on Interrupts and Dual Mode Operation.)\n</p>, <p>On many single user operating systems cooperative multitasking is perfectly adequate, as home computers generally run a small number of well tested programs. The <a href="/wiki/AmigaOS" title="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> is an exception, having preemptive multitasking from its very first version. <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT" title="Windows NT">Windows NT</a> was the first version of <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> which enforced preemptive multitasking, but it didn\'t reach the home user market until <a href="/wiki/Windows_XP" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a> (since <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT" title="Windows NT">Windows NT</a> was targeted at professionals).\n</p>, <p>Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all operating systems. Computers store data on <a href="/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" title="Hard disk drive">disks</a> using <a href="/wiki/Computer_file" title="Computer file">files</a>, which are structured in specific ways in order to allow for faster access, higher reliability, and to make better use of the drive\'s available space. The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is called a <a href="/wiki/File_system" title="File system">file system</a>, and enables files to have names and attributes. It also allows them to be stored in a hierarchy of directories or folders arranged in a <a href="/wiki/Directory_(computing)" title="Directory (computing)">directory tree</a>.\n</p>, <p>Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system. Early file systems were limited in their capacity, speed, and in the kinds of file names and directory structures they could use. These limitations often reflected limitations in the operating systems they were designed for, making it very difficult for an operating system to support more than one file system.\n</p>, <p>While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">UNIX</a> and <a href="/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a> support a technology known as a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_file_system" title="Virtual file system">virtual file system</a> or VFS. An operating system such as UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or <a href="/wiki/File_system" title="File system">file systems</a>, allowing them to be accessed through a common <a href="/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="Application programming interface">application programming interface</a> (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific <a href="/wiki/Device_driver" title="Device driver">device drivers</a> and file system drivers.\n</p>, <p>A connected <a href="/wiki/Data_storage" title="Data storage">storage device</a>, such as a <a href="/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" title="Hard disk drive">hard drive</a>, is accessed through a <a href="/wiki/Device_driver" title="Device driver">device driver</a>. The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drives. On UNIX, this is the language of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Block_device" title="Block device">block devices</a>.\n</p>, <p>When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place, it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format, which may contain one or more file systems. A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems. Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames, and directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure. They can create, delete, open, and close files, as well as gather various information about them, including access permissions, size, free space, and creation and modification dates.\n</p>, <p>Various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems difficult. Allowed characters in file names, <a href="/wiki/Case_sensitivity" title="Case sensitivity">case sensitivity</a>, and the presence of various kinds of <a href="/wiki/File_attribute" title="File attribute">file attributes</a> makes the implementation of a single interface for every file system a daunting task. Operating systems tend to recommend using (and so support natively) file systems specifically designed for them; for example, <a href="/wiki/NTFS" title="NTFS">NTFS</a> in Windows and <a href="/wiki/Ext3" title="Ext3">ext3</a> and <a href="/wiki/ReiserFS" title="ReiserFS">ReiserFS</a> in Linux. However, in practice, third party drivers are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose operating systems (for example, NTFS is available in Linux through <a href="/wiki/NTFS-3G" title="NTFS-3G">NTFS-3g</a>, and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through third-party software).\n</p>, <p>Support for file systems is highly varied among modern operating systems, although there are several common file systems which almost all operating systems include support and drivers for. Operating systems vary on file system support and on the disk formats they may be installed on. Under Windows, each file system is usually limited in application to certain media; for example, CDs must use <a href="/wiki/ISO_9660" title="ISO 9660">ISO 9660</a> or <a href="/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format" title="Universal Disk Format">UDF</a>, and as of <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a>, NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed on.  It is possible to install Linux onto many types of file systems. Unlike other operating systems, Linux and UNIX allow any file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in, whether it is a hard drive, a disc (CD, DVD...), a USB flash drive, or even contained within a file located on another file system.\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Device_driver" title="Device driver">device driver</a> is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices. Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications. It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also operating system specific that enables another program, typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel, to interact transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs.\n</p>, <p>The key design goal of device drivers is  <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)" title="Abstraction (software engineering)">abstraction</a>. Every model of hardware (even within the same class of device) is different. Newer models also are released by manufacturers that provide more reliable or better performance and these newer models are often controlled differently. Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device, both now and in the future. To solve this problem, operating systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled. The function of the device driver is then to translate these operating system mandated function calls into device specific calls. In theory a new device, which is controlled in a new manner, should function correctly if a suitable driver is available. This new driver ensures that the device appears to operate as usual from the operating system\'s point of view.\n</p>, <p>Under versions of Windows before Vista and versions of Linux before 2.6, all driver execution was co-operative, meaning that if a driver entered an infinite loop it would freeze the system. More recent revisions of these operating systems incorporate kernel preemption, where the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks, and then separates itself from the process until it receives a response from the device driver, or gives it more tasks to do.\n</p>, <p>Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a> for sharing resources such as <a href="/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" title="Remote procedure call">computing</a>, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer\'s operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer\'s graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as <a href="/wiki/Secure_Shell" title="Secure Shell">SSH</a> which allows networked users direct access to a computer\'s command line interface.\n</p>, <p>Client/server networking allows a program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server\'s <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">IP address</a>. Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible for handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.\n</p>, <p>Many operating systems support one or more vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well, for example, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Systems_Network_Architecture" title="Systems Network Architecture">SNA</a> on <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> systems, <a href="/wiki/DECnet" title="DECnet">DECnet</a> on systems from <a href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, and Microsoft-specific protocols (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Server_message_block" title="Server message block">SMB</a>) on Windows. Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as <a href="/wiki/Network_File_System" title="Network File System">NFS</a> for file access. Protocols like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ESound" title="ESound">ESound</a>, or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound from local applications, on a remote system\'s sound hardware.\n</p>, <p>A computer being secure depends on a number of technologies working properly. A modern operating system provides access to a number of resources, which are available to software running on the system, and to external devices like networks via the kernel.\n</p>, <p>The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish between "privileged" and "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester <i>identity</i>, such as a user name. To establish identity there may be a process of <i>authentication</i>. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic cards or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept of requester <b>identity</b> is <i>authorization</i>; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester\'s user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.\n</p>, <p>In addition to the allow or disallow model of security, a system with a high level of security also offers auditing options. These would allow tracking of requests for access to resources (such as, "who has been reading this file?"). Internal security, or security from an already running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be carried out through interrupts to the operating system kernel. If programs can directly access hardware and resources, they cannot be secured.\n</p>, <p>External security involves a request from outside the computer, such as a login at a connected console or some kind of network connection. External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system\'s kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Government_of_the_United_States" title="Government of the United States">Government</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> (DoD) created the <i><a href="/wiki/Trusted_Computer_System_Evaluation_Criteria" title="Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria">Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria</a></i> (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select <a href="/wiki/Trusted_operating_system" title="Trusted operating system">trusted operating systems</a> being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or <a href="/wiki/Classified_information" title="Classified information">classified information</a>.\n</p>, <p>Network services include offerings such as file sharing, print services, email, web sites, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/File_transfer_protocol" title="File transfer protocol">file transfer protocols</a> (FTP), most of which can have compromised security. At the front line of security are hardware devices known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Firewall_(networking)" title="Firewall (networking)">firewalls</a> or intrusion detection/prevention systems. At the operating system level, there are a number of software firewalls available, as well as intrusion detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include a software firewall, which is enabled by default. A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system. Therefore, one can install and be running an insecure service, such as Telnet or FTP, and not have to be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that port.\n</p>, <p>An alternative strategy, and the only <a href="/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)" title="Sandbox (computer security)">sandbox</a> strategy available in systems that do not meet the <a href="/wiki/Popek_and_Goldberg_virtualization_requirements" title="Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements">Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements</a>, is where the operating system is not running user programs as native code, but instead either <a href="/wiki/Emulator" title="Emulator">emulates</a> a processor or provides a host for a <a href="/wiki/P-code_machine" title="P-code machine">p-code</a> based system such as Java.\n</p>, <p>Internal security is especially relevant for multi-user systems; it allows each user of the system to have private files that the other users cannot tamper with or read. Internal security is also vital if auditing is to be of any use, since a program can potentially bypass the operating system, inclusive of bypassing auditing.\n</p>, <p>Every computer that is to be operated by an individual requires a <a href="/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a>. The user interface is usually referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Shell_(computing)" title="Shell (computing)">shell</a> and is essential if human interaction is to be supported.  The user interface views the <a href="/wiki/Directory_structure" title="Directory structure">directory structure</a> and requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from <a href="/wiki/Input_device" title="Input device">input hardware devices</a>, such as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keyboard_(computing)" title="Keyboard (computing)">keyboard</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mouse_(computing)" title="Mouse (computing)">mouse</a> or <a href="/wiki/Credit_card" title="Credit card">credit card reader</a>, and requests operating system services to display <a href="/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt" title="Command-line interface">prompts</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Status_message" title="Status message">status messages</a> and such on <a href="/wiki/Output_device" title="Output device">output hardware devices</a>, such as a <a href="/wiki/Computer_monitor" title="Computer monitor">video monitor</a> or <a href="/wiki/Printer_(computing)" title="Printer (computing)">printer</a>. The two most common forms of a user interface have historically been the <a href="/wiki/Command-line_interface" title="Command-line interface">command-line interface</a>, where computer commands are typed out line-by-line, and the <a href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interface</a>, where a visual environment (most commonly a <a href="/wiki/WIMP_(computing)" title="WIMP (computing)">WIMP</a>) is present.\n</p>, <p>Most of the modern computer systems support <a href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interfaces</a> (GUI), and often include them. In some computer systems, such as the original implementation of the <a href="/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS" title="Classic Mac OS">classic Mac OS</a>, the GUI is integrated into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a>.\n</p>, <p>While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of <a href="/wiki/Context_switch" title="Context switch">context switches</a> required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are <a href="/wiki/Modular_programming" title="Modular programming">modular</a>, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. Linux and macOS are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space; however the graphics drawing routines of versions between <a href="/wiki/Windows_NT_4.0" title="Windows NT 4.0">Windows NT 4.0</a> and <a href="/wiki/Windows_Server_2003" title="Windows Server 2003">Windows Server 2003</a> exist mostly in kernel space. <a href="/wiki/Windows_9x" title="Windows 9x">Windows 9x</a> had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.\n</p>, <p>Many computer operating systems allow the user to install or create any user interface they desire. The <a href="/wiki/X_Window_System" title="X Window System">X Window System</a> in conjunction with <a href="/wiki/GNOME" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> or <a href="/wiki/KDE_Plasma_5" title="KDE Plasma 5">KDE Plasma 5</a> is a commonly found setup on most Unix and <a href="/wiki/Unix-like" title="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> (BSD, Linux, Solaris) systems. A number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Windows_shell_replacement" title="Windows shell replacement">Windows shell replacements</a> have been released for Microsoft Windows, which offer alternatives to the included <a href="/wiki/Windows_shell" title="Windows shell">Windows shell</a>, but the shell itself cannot be separated from Windows.\n</p>, <p>Numerous Unix-based GUIs have existed over time, most derived from X11. Competition among the various vendors of Unix (HP, IBM, Sun) led to much fragmentation, though an effort to standardize in the 1990s to <a href="/wiki/Common_Open_Software_Environment" title="Common Open Software Environment">COSE</a> and <a href="/wiki/Common_Desktop_Environment" title="Common Desktop Environment">CDE</a> failed for various reasons, and were eventually eclipsed by the widespread adoption of GNOME and <a href="/wiki/KDE" title="KDE">K Desktop Environment</a>. Prior to <a href="/wiki/Free_software" title="Free software">free software</a>-based toolkits and desktop environments, Motif was the prevalent toolkit/desktop combination (and was the basis upon which CDE was developed).\n</p>, <p>Graphical user interfaces evolve over time. For example, Windows has modified its user interface almost every time a new major version of Windows is released, and the Mac OS GUI changed dramatically with the introduction of Mac OS X in 1999.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-intro-date_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-intro-date-32">[32]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system intended for applications with fixed deadlines (<a href="/wiki/Real-time_computing" title="Real-time computing">real-time computing</a>).
