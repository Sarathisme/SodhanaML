Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> that exist today, including <a href="/wiki/Edge_detection" title="Edge detection">extraction of edges</a> from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and <a href="/wiki/Polyhedron_model" title="Polyhedron model">polyhedral modeling</a>, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, <a href="/wiki/Optical_flow" title="Optical flow">optical flow</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Motion_estimation" title="Motion estimation">motion estimation</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Szeliski2010_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Szeliski2010-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision.

Research in <a href="/wiki/Projective_geometry" title="Projective geometry">projective</a> <a href="/wiki/3D_reconstruction" title="3D reconstruction">3-D reconstructions</a> led to better understanding of <a href="/wiki/Camera_resectioning" title="Camera resectioning">camera calibration</a>.

This led to methods for sparse <a href="/wiki/3D_reconstruction_from_multiple_images" title="3D reconstruction from multiple images">3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images</a>. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, <a href="/wiki/Graph_cuts_in_computer_vision" title="Graph cuts in computer vision">variations of graph cut</a> were used to solve <a href="/wiki/Image_segmentation" title="Image segmentation">image segmentation</a>. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see <a href="/wiki/Eigenface" title="Eigenface">Eigenface</a>). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of <a href="/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science)" title="Computer graphics (computer science)">computer graphics</a> and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, <a href="/wiki/Morphing" title="Morphing">image morphing</a>, view interpolation, <a href="/wiki/Image_stitching" title="Image stitching">panoramic image stitching</a> and early <a href="/wiki/Light_field" title="Light field">light-field rendering</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Szeliski2010_11-2"><a href="#cite_note-Szeliski2010-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Recent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Sebe2005_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sebe2005-15">[15]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Freeman2008_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-Freeman2008-16">[16]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Areas of <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotical systems to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Robotic_navigation" title="Robotic navigation">navigate through an environment</a>. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot.\n</p>, <p>Artificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as <a href="/wiki/Pattern_recognition" title="Pattern recognition">pattern recognition</a> and learning techniques. Consequently, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.\n</p>, <p>Computer vision is often considered to be part of <a href="/wiki/Information_engineering_(field)" title="Information engineering (field)">information engineering</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Solid-state_physics" title="Solid-state physics">Solid-state physics</a> is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Image_sensors" title="Image sensors">image sensors</a>, which detect <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>, which is typically in the form of either <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Visible_light" title="Visible light">visible</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infra-red_light" title="Infra-red light">infra-red light</a>. The sensors are designed using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quantum_physics" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a>. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of <a href="/wiki/Optics" title="Optics">optics</a> which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Image_sensors" title="Image sensors">image sensors</a> even require <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Szeliski2010_11-3"><a href="#cite_note-Szeliski2010-11">[11]</a></sup> Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.\n</p>, <p>A third field which plays an important role is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neurobiology" title="Neurobiology">neurobiology</a>, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how "real" vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (<i>e.g.</i> <a href="/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" title="Artificial neural network">neural net</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deep_learning" title="Deep learning">deep learning</a> based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in biology.\n</p>, <p>Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_vision" title="Biological vision">biological vision</a> \xe2\x80\x93 indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-TextbookP1_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-TextbookP1-19">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Yet another field related to computer vision is <a href="/wiki/Signal_processing" title="Signal processing">signal processing</a>. Many methods for processing of one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision which have no counterpart in processing of one-variable signals. Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.\n</p>, <p>Beside the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on <a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics)" title="Optimization (mathematics)">optimization</a> or <a href="/wiki/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer Vision is also used in Fashion Ecommerce, Inventory Management, Patent Search, Furniture, Beauty Industry as well.\n</p>, <p>The fields most closely related to computer vision are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Image_processing" title="Image processing">image processing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Image_analysis" title="Image analysis">image analysis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Machine_vision" title="Machine vision">machine vision</a>. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Computer_graphics" title="Computer graphics">Computer graphics</a> produces image data from 3D models, computer vision often produces 3D models from image data <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3DVAE_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-3DVAE-20">[20]</a></sup>. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, <i>e.g.</i>, as explored in <a href="/wiki/Augmented_reality" title="Augmented reality">augmented reality</a>.\n</p>, <p>The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Photogrammetry" title="Photogrammetry">Photogrammetry</a> also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stereophotogrammetry" title="Stereophotogrammetry">stereophotogrammetry</a> vs. <a href="/wiki/Computer_stereo_vision" title="Computer stereo vision">computer stereo vision</a>.\n</p>, <p>Applications range from tasks such as industrial <a href="/wiki/Machine_vision" title="Machine vision">machine vision</a> systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:\n</p>, <p>One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer-assisted_diagnosis" title="Computer-assisted diagnosis">diagnose a patient</a>. An example of this is detection of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tumour" title="Tumour">tumours</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arteriosclerosis" title="Arteriosclerosis">arteriosclerosis</a> or other malign changes; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information: <i>e.g.</i>, about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans\xe2\x80\x94ultrasonic images or X-ray images for example\xe2\x80\x94to reduce the influence of noise.\n</p>, <p>A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called <a href="/wiki/Machine_vision" title="Machine vision">machine vision</a>, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a manufacturing process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called <a href="/wiki/Optical_sorting" title="Optical sorting">optical sorting</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Davies-2005_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-Davies-2005-24">[24]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Military applications are probably one of the largest areas for computer vision. The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and <a href="/wiki/Missile_guidance" title="Missile guidance">missile guidance</a>. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as "battlefield awareness", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.\n</p>, <p>One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include <a href="/wiki/Submersible" title="Submersible">submersibles</a>, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (<a href="/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle" title="Unmanned aerial vehicle">UAV</a>). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment (<a href="/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping" title="Simultaneous localization and mapping">SLAM</a>) and for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, <i>e.g.</i>, a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Driverless_car" title="Driverless car">autonomous driving of cars</a>, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, <i>e.g.</i>, NASA\'s <a href="/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover" title="Mars Exploration Rover">Mars Exploration Rover</a> and ESA\'s <a href="/wiki/ExoMars" title="ExoMars">ExoMars</a> Rover.\n</p>, <p>Other application areas include:\n</p>, <p>Each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.\n</p>, <p>Computer vision tasks include methods for <a href="/wiki/Image_sensor" title="Image sensor">acquiring</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Image_processing" title="Image processing">processing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Image_analysis" title="Image analysis">analyzing</a> and understanding digital images, and extraction of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High-dimensional" title="High-dimensional">high-dimensional</a> data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, <i>e.g.</i>, in the forms of decisions.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Klette-2014_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-Klette-2014-4">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Shapiro-Stockman-2001_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-Shapiro-Stockman-2001-5">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Morris-2004_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-Morris-2004-6">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Jahne-Haussecker-2000_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-Jahne-Haussecker-2000-7">[7]</a></sup> Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action.

Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature:<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

An illustration of their capabilities is given by the <a href="/wiki/ImageNet#ImageNet_Challenge" title="ImageNet">ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge</a>; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and hundreds of object classes. Performance of convolutional neural networks, on the ImageNet tests, is now close to that of humans.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras). By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.\n</p>, <p>Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:\n</p>, <p>Several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images . Examples of such tasks are:\n</p>, <p>Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at <a href="/wiki/3D_reconstruction" title="3D reconstruction">computing a 3D model</a> of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model. The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3DVAE_20-2"><a href="#cite_note-3DVAE-20">[20]</a></sup>.\n</p>, <p>The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.\n</p>, <p>An example in this field is <a href="/wiki/Inpainting" title="Inpainting">inpainting</a>.\n</p>, <p>The organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.\n</p>, <p>Image-understanding systems (IUS) include three levels of abstraction as follows: Low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions; intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are really topics for further research.\n</p>, <p>The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.\n</p>, <p>While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>There are many kinds of computer vision systems, nevertheless all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (i.e. camera, ccd, etc.), a processor as well as control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism. In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system. Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment. Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories like camera supports, cables and connectors.\n</p>, <p>Most computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).\n</p>, <p>A few computer vision systems use image acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both.\nFor example, a <a href="/wiki/Structured-light_3D_scanner" title="Structured-light 3D scanner">structured-light 3D scanner</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Thermographic_camera" title="Thermographic camera">thermographic camera</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyperspectral_imager" title="Hyperspectral imager">hyperspectral imager</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Radar_imaging" title="Radar imaging">radar imaging</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Lidar" title="Lidar">lidar</a> scanner, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_image" title="Magnetic resonance image">magnetic resonance image</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Side-scan_sonar" title="Side-scan sonar">side-scan sonar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_aperture_sonar" title="Synthetic aperture sonar">synthetic aperture sonar</a>, or etc.\nSuch hardware captures "images" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.\n</p>, <p>While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in <a href="/wiki/Digital_signal_processing" title="Digital signal processing">digital signal processing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" title="Graphics processing unit">consumer graphics hardware</a> has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second. For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms. When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realised.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Egocentric_vision" title="Egocentric vision">Egocentric vision</a> systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective. \n</p>, <p>As of 2016, <a href="/wiki/Vision_processing_unit" title="Vision processing unit">vision processing units</a> are emerging as a new class of processor, to complement CPUs and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Graphics_processing_units" title="Graphics processing units">graphics processing units</a> (GPUs) in this role.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-the_rise_of_VPUs_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-the_rise_of_VPUs-32">[32]</a></sup>\n</p>]
