It not only provided the means to compile the digital library but the access to the books by millions of individuals on the worldwide web. \n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> and <a href="/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider" title="J.

After seeing the disaster, he wanted to create a machine that would show how technology can lead to understanding instead of destruction. This machine would include a desk with two screens, switches and buttons, and a keyboard.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> He named this the "<a href="/wiki/Memex" title="Memex">Memex</a>." This way individuals would be able to access stored books and files at a rapid speed. In 1956, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Foundation" title="Ford Foundation">Ford Foundation</a> funded Licklider to analyze how libraries could be improved with technology. Almost a decade later, his book entitled "<i>Libraries of the Future</i>" included his vision. He wanted to create a system that would use computers and networks so human knowledge would be accessible for human needs and feedback would be automatic for machine purposes. This system contained three components, the corpus of knowledge, the question, and the answer. Licklider called it a procognitive system.\n</p>, <p>Early projects centered on the creation of an electronic card catalogue known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Online_Public_Access_Catalog" title="Online Public Access Catalog">Online Public Access Catalog</a> (OPAC). By the 1980s, the success of these endeavors resulted in OPAC replacing the traditional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Card_catalog" title="Card catalog">card catalog</a> in many academic, public and special libraries. This permitted libraries to undertake additional rewarding co-operative efforts to support resource sharing and expand access to library materials beyond an individual library.\n</p>, <p>An early example of a digital library is the <a href="/wiki/Education_Resources_Information_Center" title="Education Resources Information Center">Education Resources Information Center (ERIC)</a>, a database of education citations and abstracts, which was created in 1964 and made available online through <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=DIALOG&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="DIALOG (page does not exist)">DIALOG</a> in 1969.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In 1994, digital libraries became visible due to a $24.4 million [NSF] managed program supported jointly by [DARPA]\'s Intelligent Integration of Information (I3) program, [NASA], and NSF itself <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>\n.

In the early days of digital libraries, there was discussion of the similarities and differences among the terms <i>digital</i>, <i>virtual</i>, and <i>electronic</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A distinction is often made between content that was created in a digital format, known as <a href="/wiki/Born-digital" title="Born-digital">born-digital</a>, and information that has been converted from a physical medium, e.g. paper, through <a href="/wiki/Digitization" title="Digitization">digitization</a>.

Others, such as the <a href="/wiki/Digital_Public_Library_of_America" title="Digital Public Library of America">Digital Public Library of America</a>, seek to make digital information from various institutions widely accessible online.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Many academic libraries are actively involved in building <a href="/wiki/Institutional_repository" title="Institutional repository">institutional repositories</a> of the institution\'s books, papers, theses, and other works which can be digitized or were \'born digital\'. Many of these repositories are made available to the general public with few restrictions, in accordance with the goals of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)" title="Open access (publishing)">open access</a>, in contrast to the publication of research in commercial journals, where the publishers often limit access rights. Institutional, truly free, and corporate repositories are sometimes referred to as digital libraries. <a href="/wiki/Institutional_repository" title="Institutional repository">Institutional repository</a> software is designed for archiving, organizing, and searching a library\'s content.

Traditionally, archives are defined as:\n</p>, <p>The technology used to create digital libraries is even more revolutionary for archives since it breaks down the second and third of these general rules. In other words, "digital archives" or "online archives" will still generally contain primary sources, but they are likely to be described individually rather than (or in addition to) in groups or collections. Further, because they are digital, their contents are easily reproducible and may indeed have been reproduced from elsewhere. The <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Text_Archive" title="Oxford Text Archive">Oxford Text Archive</a> is generally considered to be the oldest digital archive of academic physical primary source materials.\n</p>, <p>Archives differ from libraries in the nature of the materials held. Libraries collect individual published books and serials, or bounded sets of individual items. The books and journals held by libraries are not unique, since multiple copies exist and any given copy will generally prove as satisfactory as any other copy. The material in archives and manuscript libraries are "the unique records of corporate bodies and the papers of individuals and families".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A fundamental characteristic of archives is that they have to keep the context in which their records have been created and the network of relationships between them in order to preserve their informative content and provide understandable and useful information over time. The fundamental characteristic of archives resides in their hierarchical organization expressing the context by means of the <a href="/wiki/Archival_bond" title="Archival bond">archival bond</a>.\nArchival descriptions are the fundamental means to describe, understand, retrieve and access archival material. At the digital level, archival descriptions are usually encoded by means of the <a href="/wiki/Encoded_Archival_Description" title="Encoded Archival Description">Encoded Archival Description</a> XML format.  The EAD is a standardized electronic representation of archival description which makes it possible to provide union access to detailed archival descriptions and resources in repositories distributed throughout the world.\n</p>, <p>Given the importance of archives, a dedicated formal model, called <a class="external text" href="http://nestor.dei.unipd.it/" rel="nofollow">NEsted SeTs for Object Hierarchies (NESTOR)</a>,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> built around their peculiar constituents, has been defined. NESTOR is based on the idea of expressing the hierarchical relationships between objects through the inclusion property between sets, in contrast to the binary relation between nodes exploited by the tree. \nNESTOR has been used to formally extend the 5S model to define a digital archive as a specific case of digital library able to take into consideration the peculiar features of archives.\n</p>, <p>The advantages of digital libraries as a means of easily and rapidly accessing books, archives and images of various types are now widely recognized by commercial interests and public bodies alike.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Traditional libraries are limited by storage space; digital libraries have the potential to store much more information, simply because digital information requires very little physical space to contain it.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> As such, the cost of maintaining a digital library can be much lower than that of a traditional library. A physical library must spend large sums of money paying for staff, book maintenance, rent, and additional books. Digital libraries may reduce or, in some instances, do away with these fees. Both types of library require cataloging input to allow users to locate and retrieve material. Digital libraries may be more willing to adopt innovations in technology providing users with improvements in electronic and audio book technology as well as presenting new forms of communication such as wikis and blogs; conventional libraries may consider that providing online access to their OP AC catalog is sufficient. An important advantage to digital conversion is increased accessibility to users. They also increase availability to individuals who may not be traditional patrons of a library, due to geographic location or organizational affiliation.\n</p>, <p>There are a number of software packages for use in general digital libraries, for notable ones see <a href="/wiki/Category:Digital_library_software" title="Category:Digital library software">Digital library software</a>. Institutional repository software, which focuses primarily on ingest, preservation and access of locally produced documents, particularly locally produced academic outputs, can be found in <a href="/wiki/Category:Institutional_repository_software" title="Category:Institutional repository software">Institutional repository software</a>. This software may be proprietary, as is the case with the Library of Congress which uses Digiboard and CTS to manage digital content.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The design and implementation in digital libraries are constructed so computer systems and software can make use of the information when it is exchanged. These are referred to as semantic digital libraries. Semantic libraries are also used to socialize with different communities from a mass of social networks.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> <b>DjDL</b> is a type of semantic digital library. Keywords-based and semantic search are the two main types of searches. A tool is provided in the semantic search that create a group for augmentation and refinement for keywords-based search. Conceptual knowledge used in <b>DjDL</b> is centered around two forms; the subject <a href="/wiki/Ontology" title="Ontology">ontology</a> and the set of concept search patterns based on the ontology. The three type of ontologies that are associated to this search are <a href="/wiki/Bibliographic_Ontology" title="Bibliographic Ontology">bibliographic ontologies</a>, community-aware ontologies, and subject ontologies.\n</p>, <p>In traditional libraries, the ability to find works of interest is directly related to how well they were cataloged. While cataloging electronic works digitized from a library\'s existing holding may be as simple as copying or moving a record from the print to the electronic form, complex and born-digital works require substantially more effort. To handle the growing volume of electronic publications, new tools and technologies have to be designed to allow effective automated semantic classification and searching. While <a href="/wiki/Full-text_search" title="Full-text search">full-text search</a> can be used for some items, there are many common catalog searches which cannot be performed using full text, including: \n</p>, <p>Most digital libraries provide a search interface which allows resources to be found. These resources are typically <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deep_Web_(search_indexing)" title="Deep Web (search indexing)">deep web</a> (or invisible web) resources since they frequently cannot be located by <a href="/wiki/Search_engine_(computing)" title="Search engine (computing)">search engine</a> <a href="/wiki/Web_crawler" title="Web crawler">crawlers</a>. Some digital libraries create special pages or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sitemap" title="Sitemap">sitemaps</a> to allow search engines to find all their resources. Digital libraries frequently use the <a href="/wiki/Open_Archives_Initiative_Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting" title="Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting">Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a> (OAI-PMH) to expose their metadata to other digital libraries, and search engines like <a href="/wiki/Google_Scholar" title="Google Scholar">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scirus" title="Scirus">Scirus</a> can also use OAI-PMH to find these deep web resources.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>There are two general strategies for searching a <i>federation</i> of digital libraries: distributed searching and searching previously harvested <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a>.\n</p>, <p>Distributed searching typically involves a client sending multiple search requests in parallel to a number of servers in the federation. The results are gathered, duplicates are eliminated or clustered, and the remaining items are sorted and presented back to the client. Protocols like <a href="/wiki/Z39.50" title="Z39.50">Z39.50</a> are frequently used in distributed searching. A benefit to this approach is that the resource-intensive tasks of indexing and storage are left to the respective servers in the federation. A drawback to this approach is that the search mechanism is limited by the different indexing and ranking capabilities of each database; therefore, making it difficult to assemble a combined result consisting of the most relevant found items.\n</p>, <p>Searching over previously harvested metadata involves searching a locally stored <a href="/wiki/Search_engine_indexing" title="Search engine indexing">index</a> of information that has previously been collected from the libraries in the federation. When a search is performed, the search mechanism does not need to make connections with the digital libraries it is searching - it already has a local representation of the information. This approach requires the creation of an indexing and harvesting mechanism which operates regularly, connecting to all the digital libraries and querying the whole collection in order to discover new and updated resources. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OAI-PMH" title="OAI-PMH">OAI-PMH</a> is frequently used by digital libraries for allowing metadata to be harvested. A benefit to this approach is that the search mechanism has full control over indexing and ranking algorithms, possibly allowing more consistent results. A drawback is that harvesting and indexing systems are more resource-intensive and therefore expensive.\n</p>, <p>Digital preservation aims to ensure that digital media and information systems are still interpretable into the indefinite future.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Each necessary component of this must be migrated, preserved or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emulated" title="Emulated">emulated</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Cain,_Mark_p_29_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-Cain,_Mark_p_29-27">[27]</a></sup> Typically lower levels of systems (<a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a> for example) are emulated, bit-streams (the actual files stored in the disks) are preserved and operating systems are emulated as a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machine</a>.

The republication of material on the web by libraries may require permission from rights holders, and there is a conflict of interest between libraries and the publishers who may wish to create online versions of their acquired content for commercial purposes. In 2010, it was estimated that twenty-three percent of books in existence were created before 1923 and thus out of copyright. Of those printed after this date, only five percent were still in print as of 2010. Thus, approximately seventy-two percent of books were not available to the public.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>There is a dilution of responsibility that occurs as a result of the distributed nature of digital resources.

It also criminalizes the act of attempting to circumvent access control.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>  This act provides an exemption for nonprofit libraries and archives which allows up to three copies to be made, one of which may be digital.

Further, it allows libraries and archives to copy a work if its format becomes obsolete.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Copyright issues persist. As such, proposals have been put forward suggesting that digital libraries be exempt from copyright law. Although this would be very beneficial to the public, it may have a negative economic effect and authors may be less inclined to create new works.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Another issue that complicates matters is the desire of some publishing houses to restrict the use of digit materials such as e-books purchased by libraries. Whereas with printed books, the library owns the book until it can no longer be circulated, publishers want to limit the number of times an e-book can be checked out before the library would need to repurchase that book. "[HarperCollins] began licensing use of each e-book copy for a maximum of 26 loans. This affects only the most popular titles and has no practical effect on others.
