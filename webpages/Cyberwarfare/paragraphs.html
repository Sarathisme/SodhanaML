At the most basic level, cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare.  For example, tampering with the operation of air defences via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>  Aside from these "hard" threats, cyber warfare can also contribute towards "soft" threats such as espionage and propaganda.\n</p>, <p>Traditional espionage is not an act of war, nor is cyber-espionage, and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Despite this assumption, some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations, and are often described as "attacks". For example:\n</p>, <p>Computers and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Satellites" title="Satellites">satellites</a> that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment.

For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive.  The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective.  Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences.  Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies.  A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation.  This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage.  In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating.
