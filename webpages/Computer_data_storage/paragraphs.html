[<p><b>Computer data storage</b>, often called <b>storage</b> or <b>memory</b>, is a technology consisting of <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> components and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Data_storage_device" title="Data storage device">recording media</a> that are used to retain digital <a href="/wiki/Data_(computing)" title="Data (computing)">data</a>.

In practice, almost all computers use a <a href="/wiki/Memory_hierarchy" title="Memory hierarchy">storage hierarchy</a>,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Patterson_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Patterson-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>468\xe2\x80\x93473</span></sup> which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away. Generally the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as "memory", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as "storage".\n</p>, <p>In the <a href="/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" title="Von Neumann architecture">Von Neumann architecture</a>, the CPU consists of two main parts: The <a href="/wiki/Control_unit" title="Control unit">control unit</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit" title="Arithmetic logic unit">arithmetic logic unit</a> (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bitwise_operations" title="Bitwise operations">logical operations</a> on data.\n</p>, <p>Without a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk <a href="/wiki/Calculator" title="Calculator">calculators</a>, <a href="/wiki/Digital_signal_processing" title="Digital signal processing">digital signal processors</a>, and other specialized devices. <a href="/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" title="Von Neumann architecture">Von Neumann</a> machines differ in having a memory in which they store their operating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instruction_(computer_science)" title="Instruction (computer science)">instructions</a> and data.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Patterson_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Patterson-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>20</span></sup> Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program, but can simply be <a href="/wiki/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">reprogrammed</a> with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be simpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Program_state" title="Program state">state</a> between successive computations to build up complex procedural results. Most modern computers are von Neumann machines.\n</p>, <p>A modern <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">digital computer</a> represents <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a> using the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Binary_numeral_system" title="Binary numeral system">binary numeral system</a>. Text, numbers, pictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of <a href="/wiki/Bit" title="Bit">bits</a>, or binary digits, each of which has a value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the <a href="/wiki/Byte" title="Byte">byte</a>, equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any computer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate <i>the binary representation of the piece of information</i>, or simply <a href="/wiki/Data_(computing)" title="Data (computing)">data</a>. For example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Complete_works_of_Shakespeare" title="Complete works of Shakespeare">complete works of Shakespeare</a>, about 1250 pages in print, can be stored in about five <a href="/wiki/Megabyte" title="Megabyte">megabytes</a> (40 million bits) with one byte per character.\n</p>, <p>Data are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Encoding" title="Encoding">encoded</a> by assigning a bit pattern to each <a href="/wiki/Character_(computing)" title="Character (computing)">character</a>, <a href="/wiki/Numerical_digit" title="Numerical digit">digit</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Multimedia" title="Multimedia">multimedia</a> object. Many standards exist for encoding (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Character_encoding" title="Character encoding">character encodings</a> like <a href="/wiki/ASCII" title="ASCII">ASCII</a>, image encodings like <a href="/wiki/JPEG" title="JPEG">JPEG</a>, video encodings like <a href="/wiki/MPEG-4" title="MPEG-4">MPEG-4</a>).\n</p>, <p>By adding bits to each encoded unit, redundancy allows the computer to both detect errors in coded data and correct them based on mathematical algorithms. Errors generally occur in low probabilities due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Random" title="Random">random</a> bit value flipping, or "physical bit fatigue", loss of the physical bit in storage of its ability to maintain a distinguishable value (0 or 1), or due to errors in inter or intra-computer communication. A random <a href="/wiki/RAM_parity" title="RAM parity">bit flip</a> (e.g., due to random <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a>) is typically corrected upon detection. A bit, or a group of malfunctioning physical bits (not always the specific defective bit is known; group definition depends on specific storage device) is typically automatically fenced-out, taken out of use by the device, and replaced with another functioning equivalent group in the device, where the corrected bit values are restored (if possible). The <a href="/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check" title="Cyclic redundancy check">cyclic redundancy check</a> (CRC) method is typically used in communications and storage for <a href="/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction" title="Error detection and correction">error detection</a>.  A detected error is then retried.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Data_compression" title="Data compression">Data compression</a> methods allow in many cases (such as a database) to represent a string of bits by a shorter bit string ("compress") and reconstruct the original string ("decompress") when needed. This utilizes substantially less storage (tens of percents) for many types of data at the cost of more computation (compress and decompress when needed). Analysis of trade-off between storage cost saving and costs of related computations and possible delays in data availability is done before deciding whether to keep certain data compressed or not.\n</p>, <p>For <a href="/wiki/Data_security" title="Data security">security reasons</a> certain types of data (e.g., credit-card information) may be kept <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encrypted</a> in storage to prevent the possibility of unauthorized information reconstruction from chunks of storage snapshots.\n</p>, <p>Generally, the lower a storage is in the hierarchy, the lesser its <a href="/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)" title="Bandwidth (computing)">bandwidth</a> and the greater its access <a href="/wiki/Latency_(engineering)" title="Latency (engineering)">latency</a> is from the CPU. This traditional division of storage to primary, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage is also guided by cost per bit.\n</p>, <p>In contemporary usage, "memory" is usually <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> storage read-write <a href="/wiki/Random-access_memory" title="Random-access memory">random-access memory</a>, typically <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DRAM" title="DRAM">DRAM</a> (dynamic RAM) or other forms of fast but temporary storage. "Storage" consists of storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPU" title="CPU">CPU</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Secondary_storage" title="Secondary storage">secondary</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tertiary_storage" title="Tertiary storage">tertiary storage</a>), typically <a href="/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" title="Hard disk drive">hard disk drives</a>, <a href="/wiki/Optical_disc" title="Optical disc">optical disc</a> drives, and other devices slower than RAM but <a href="/wiki/Non-volatile_memory" title="Non-volatile memory">non-volatile</a> (retaining contents when powered down).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Historically, <i>memory</i> has been called <i>core memory</i>, <i>main memory</i>, <i>real storage</i> or <i>internal memory</i>. Meanwhile, non-volatile storage devices have been referred to as <i>secondary storage</i>, <i>external memory</i> or <i>auxiliary/peripheral storage</i>.\n</p>, <p><i>Primary storage</i> (also known as <i>main memory</i> or <i>internal memory</i>), often referred to simply as <i>memory</i>, is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner.\n</p>, <p>Historically, <a href="/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware" title="History of computing hardware">early computers</a> used <a href="/wiki/Delay_line_memory" title="Delay line memory">delay lines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Williams_tube" title="Williams tube">Williams tubes</a>, or rotating <a href="/wiki/Drum_memory" title="Drum memory">magnetic drums</a> as primary storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magnetic_core_memory" title="Magnetic core memory">magnetic core memory</a>. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a> technology allowed <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor_memory" title="Semiconductor memory">semiconductor memory</a> to become economically competitive.\n</p>, <p>This led to modern <a href="/wiki/Random-access_memory" title="Random-access memory">random-access memory</a> (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the same time. (The particular types of RAM used for primary storage are also <a href="/wiki/Volatile_memory" title="Volatile memory">volatile</a>, i.e. they lose the information when not powered).\n</p>, <p>As shown in the diagram, traditionally there are two more sub-layers of the primary storage, besides main large-capacity RAM:\n</p>, <p>Main memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit via a <i>memory bus</i>. It is actually two buses (not on the diagram): an <a href="/wiki/Address_bus" title="Address bus">address bus</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Bus_(computing)" title="Bus (computing)">data bus</a>. The CPU firstly sends a number through an address bus, a number called <a href="/wiki/Memory_address" title="Memory address">memory address</a>, that indicates the desired location of data. Then it reads or writes the data in the <a href="/wiki/Memory_cell_(computing)" title="Memory cell (computing)">memory cells</a>  using the data bus. Additionally, a <a href="/wiki/Memory_management_unit" title="Memory management unit">memory management unit</a> (MMU) is a small device between CPU and RAM recalculating the actual memory address, for example to provide an abstraction of <a href="/wiki/Virtual_memory" title="Virtual memory">virtual memory</a> or other tasks.\n</p>, <p>As the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile (uninitialized at start up), a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, <a href="/wiki/Non-volatile_memory" title="Non-volatile memory">non-volatile primary storage</a> containing a small startup program (<a href="/wiki/BIOS" title="BIOS">BIOS</a>) is used to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bootstrapping_(computing)" title="Bootstrapping (computing)">bootstrap</a> the computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile <i>secondary</i> storage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory" title="Read-only memory">read-only memory</a> (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of <i><a href="/wiki/Random_access" title="Random access">random access</a></i>).\n</p>, <p>Many types of "ROM" are not literally <i>read only</i>, as updates to them are possible; however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re-written. Some <a href="/wiki/Embedded_system" title="Embedded system">embedded systems</a> run programs directly from ROM (or similar), because such programs are rarely changed. Standard computers do not store non-rudimentary programs in ROM, and rather, use large capacities of secondary storage, which is non-volatile as well, and not as costly.\n</p>, <p>Recently, <i>primary storage</i> and <i>secondary storage</i> in some uses refer to what was historically called, respectively, <i>secondary storage</i> and <i>tertiary storage</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p><i>Secondary storage</i> (also known as <i>external memory</i> or <i>auxiliary storage</i>), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its <a href="/wiki/Input/output" title="Input/output">input/output</a> channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using <a href="/wiki/Data_buffer" title="Data buffer">intermediate area</a> in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down\xe2\x80\x94it is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage. Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data are kept for a longer time there.\n</p>, <p>In modern computers, <a href="/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" title="Hard disk drive">hard disk drives</a> are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random-access memory is measured in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the  significant access-time difference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory. Rotating <a href="/wiki/Optical_disc_drive" title="Optical disc drive">optical storage</a> devices, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compact_Disc" title="Compact Disc">CD</a> and <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> drives, have even longer access times. With disk drives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.\n</p>, <p>When data reside on disk, accessing them in large blocks to hide latency offers an opportunity to design efficient <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/External_memory_algorithms" title="External memory algorithms">external memory algorithms</a>. Sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access. Another way to reduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Some other examples of secondary storage technologies are <a href="/wiki/Flash_memory" title="Flash memory">flash memory</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/USB_flash_drive" title="USB flash drive">USB flash drives</a> or keys), <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage" title="Magnetic tape data storage">magnetic tape</a>, <a href="/wiki/Punched_tape" title="Punched tape">paper tape</a>, <a href="/wiki/Punched_card" title="Punched card">punched cards</a>, standalone <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RAM_disk" title="RAM disk">RAM disks</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iomega_Zip_drive" title="Iomega Zip drive">Iomega Zip drives</a>.\n</p>, <p>The secondary storage is often formatted according to a <a href="/wiki/File_system" title="File system">file system</a> format, which provides the abstraction necessary to organize data into <a href="/wiki/Computer_file" title="Computer file">files</a> and <a href="/wiki/Directory_(computing)" title="Directory (computing)">directories</a>, providing also additional information (called <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a>) describing the owner of a certain file, the access time, the access permissions, and other information.\n</p>, <p>Most computer <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> use the concept of <a href="/wiki/Virtual_memory" title="Virtual memory">virtual memory</a>, allowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically available in the system. As the primary memory fills up, the system moves the least-used chunks (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Page_(computing)" title="Page (computing)">pages</a></i>) to secondary storage devices (to a <a href="/wiki/Paging" title="Paging">swap file</a> or <a href="/wiki/Paging" title="Paging">page file</a>), retrieving them later when they are needed. As more of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary, the more the overall system performance is degraded.\n</p>, <p><i>Tertiary storage</i> or <i>tertiary memory</i><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> provides a third level of storage. Typically, it involves a robotic mechanism which will <i>mount</i> (insert) and <i>dismount</i> removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system\'s demands; such data are often copied to secondary storage before use. It is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5\xe2\x80\x9360 seconds vs. 1\xe2\x80\x9310 milliseconds). This is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed without human operators. Typical examples include <a href="/wiki/Tape_library" title="Tape library">tape libraries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Optical_jukebox" title="Optical jukebox">optical jukeboxes</a>.\n</p>, <p>When a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will first consult a catalog <a href="/wiki/Database" title="Database">database</a> to determine which tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct a <a href="/wiki/Industrial_robot" title="Industrial robot">robotic arm</a> to fetch the medium and place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the information, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library.\n</p>, <p>Tertiary storage is also known as <i><a href="/wiki/Nearline_storage" title="Nearline storage">nearline storage</a></i> because it is "near to online". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-pearson2010_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-pearson2010-6">[6]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>For example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that spin down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MAID" title="MAID">MAID</a>), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in <a href="/wiki/Tape_library" title="Tape library">tape libraries</a>, are nearline storage, while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.\n</p>, <p><i>Off-line storage</i> is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is not under the control of a <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit">processing unit</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The medium is recorded, usually in a secondary or tertiary storage device, and then physically removed or disconnected. It must be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access it again. Unlike tertiary storage, it cannot be accessed without human interaction.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Online_and_offline" title="Online and offline">Off-line</a> storage is used to <a href="/wiki/Data_transmission" title="Data transmission">transfer information</a>, since the detached medium can be easily physically transported. Additionally, in case a disaster, for example a fire, destroys the original data, a medium in a remote location will probably be unaffected, enabling <a href="/wiki/Disaster_recovery" title="Disaster recovery">disaster recovery</a>. Off-line storage increases general <a href="/wiki/Information_security" title="Information security">information security</a>, since it is physically inaccessible from a computer, and data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer-based attack techniques. Also, if the information stored for archival purposes is rarely accessed, off-line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage.\n</p>, <p>In modern personal computers, most secondary and tertiary storage media are also used for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular, and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives. In enterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy disks, Zip disks, or punched cards.\n</p>, <p>Storage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability. For any particular implementation of any storage technology, the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Non-volatile_memory" title="Non-volatile memory">Non-volatile memory</a> retains the stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-flashnvmWork_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-flashnvmWork-8">[8]</a></sup> It is suitable for long-term storage of information. <a href="/wiki/Volatile_memory" title="Volatile memory">Volatile memory</a> requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies are volatile ones, although that is not a universal rule. Since the primary storage is required to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory" title="Dynamic random-access memory">Dynamic random-access memory</a> is a form of volatile memory that also requires the stored information to be periodically reread and rewritten, or <a href="/wiki/Memory_refresh" title="Memory refresh">refreshed</a>, otherwise it would vanish. <a href="/wiki/Static_random-access_memory" title="Static random-access memory">Static random-access memory</a> is a form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied; it loses its content when the power supply is lost.\n</p>, <p>An <a href="/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply" title="Uninterruptible power supply">uninterruptible power supply</a> (UPS) can be used to give a computer a brief window of time to move information from primary volatile storage into non-volatile storage before the batteries are exhausted.

The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance. Important characteristics of such storage are possible expansion options: adding slots, modules, drives, robots. Tape libraries may have from 10 to more than 100,000 slots, and provide <a href="/wiki/Terabyte" title="Terabyte">terabytes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Petabyte" title="Petabyte">petabytes</a> of near-line information. Optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller solutions, up to 1,000 slots.\n</p>, <p>Robotic storage is used for <a href="/wiki/Backup" title="Backup">backups</a>, and for high-capacity archives in imaging, medical, and video industries. <a href="/wiki/Hierarchical_storage_management" title="Hierarchical storage management">Hierarchical storage management</a> is a most known archiving strategy of automatically <i>migrating</i> long-unused files from fast hard disk storage to libraries or jukeboxes. If the files are needed, they are <i>retrieved</i> back to disk.\n</p>, <p><img alt="" data-file-height="196" data-file-width="196" height="12" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/18px-PD-icon.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/24px-PD-icon.svg.png 2x" width="12"/> This article incorporates <a href="/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government" title="Copyright status of work by the U.S. government">public domain material</a> from the <a href="/wiki/General_Services_Administration" title="General Services Administration">General Services Administration</a> document <a class="external text" href="http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm" rel="nofollow">"Federal Standard 1037C"</a>.\n</p>, <p class="mw-empty-elt">\n</p>]
