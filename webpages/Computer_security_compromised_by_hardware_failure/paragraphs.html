[<p><b>Computer security compromised by hardware failure</b> is a branch of <a href="/wiki/Computer_security" title="Computer security">computer security</a> applied to hardware.\nThe objective of computer security includes protection of information and property from theft, corruption, or <a href="/wiki/Natural_disaster" title="Natural disaster">natural disaster</a>, while allowing the information and property to remain accessible and productive to its intended users.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ComSec1_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-ComSec1-1">[1]</a></sup> Such secret information could be retrieved by different ways. This article focus on the retrieval of data thanks to misused hardware or hardware failure. Hardware could be misused or exploited to get secret data. This article collects main types of attack that can be lead in a data thief.\n</p>, <p>Computer security can be comprised by devices, such as keyboards, monitors or printers (thanks to electromagnetic or acoustic emanation for example) or by components of the computer, such as the memory, the network card or the processor (thanks to time or temperature analysis for example).\n</p>, <p>The monitor is the main device used to access data on a computer.  It has been shown that monitors radiate or reflect data on their environment, potentially giving attackers access to information displayed on the monitor.\n</p>, <p>Video display units radiate:\n</p>, <p>Known as compromising emanations or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TEMPEST" title="TEMPEST">TEMPEST</a> radiation, a code word for a U.S. government programme aimed at attacking the problem, the electromagnetic broadcast of data has been a significant concern in sensitive computer applications. Eavesdroppers can reconstruct video screen content from radio frequency emanations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Kuhn1_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kuhn1-3">[3]</a></sup> Each (radiated) harmonic of the video signal shows a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the picture displayed on the video display unit from the radiated emission by means of a normal television receiver.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Eck1_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Eck1-2">[2]</a></sup> If no preventive measures are taken, eavesdropping on a video display unit is possible at distances up to several hundreds of meters, using only a normal black-and-white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier. It is even possible to pick up information from some types of video display units at a distance of over 1 kilometer. If more sophisticated receiving and decoding equipment is used, the maximum distance can be much greater.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Eck2_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Eck2-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>What is displayed by the monitor is reflected on the environment. The time-varying diffuse reflections of the light emitted by a CRT monitor can be exploited to recover the original monitor image.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back1]_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Back1]-5">[5]</a></sup>  This is an eavesdropping technique for spying at a distance on data that is displayed on an arbitrary computer screen, including the currently prevalent LCD monitors.\n</p>, <p>The technique exploits reflections of the screen\xe2\x80\x99s optical emanations in various objects that one commonly finds in close proximity to the screen and uses those reflections to recover the original screen content. Such objects include eyeglasses, tea pots, spoons, plastic bottles, and even the eye of the user. This attack can be successfully mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (less than 1500 dollars) from a distance of up to 10 meters. Relying on more expensive equipment allowed to conduct this attack from over 30 meters away, demonstrating that similar attacks are feasible from the other side of the street or from a close-by building.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back3]_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Back3]-6">[6]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Many objects that may be found at a usual workplace can be exploited to retrieve information on a computer\xe2\x80\x99s display by an outsider.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back4]_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Back4]-7">[7]</a></sup> Particularly good results were obtained from reflections in a user\xe2\x80\x99s eyeglasses or a tea pot located on the desk next to the screen. Reflections that stem from the eye of the user also provide good results. However, eyes are harder to spy on at a distance because they are fast-moving objects and require high exposure times. Using more expensive equipment with lower exposure times helps to remedy this problem.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back5]_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Back5]-8">[8]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The reflections gathered from curved surfaces on close-by objects indeed pose a substantial threat to the confidentiality of data displayed on the screen. Fully invalidating this threat without at the same time hiding the screen from the legitimate user seems difficult, without using curtains on the windows or similar forms of strong optical shielding. Most users, however, will not be aware of this risk and may not be willing to close the curtains on a nice day.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back2]_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Back2]-9">[9]</a></sup> The reflection of an object, a computer display, in a curved mirror creates a virtual image that is located behind the reflecting surface. For a flat mirror this virtual image has the same size and is located behind the mirror at the same distance as the original object. For curved mirrors, however, the situation is more complex.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back6]_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Back6]-10">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Computer keyboards are often used to transmit confidential data such as passwords. Since they contain electronic components, keyboards emit electromagnetic waves. These emanations could reveal sensitive information such as keystrokes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag1_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag1-11">[11]</a></sup> Electromagnetic emanations have turned out to constitute a security threat to computer equipment.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Back2]_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-[Back2]-9">[9]</a></sup> The figure below presents how a keystroke is retrieved and what material is necessary.\n</p>, <p>The approach is to acquire the raw signal directly from the antenna and to process the entire captured electromagnetic spectrum. Thanks to this method, four different kinds of compromising electromagnetic emanations have been detected, generated by <b>wired and wireless</b> keyboards. These emissions lead to a full or a partial recovery of the keystrokes. The best practical attack fully recovered 95% of the keystrokes of a PS/2 keyboard at a distance up to 20 meters, even through walls.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag1_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag1-11">[11]</a></sup> Because each keyboard has a specific fingerprint based on the clock frequency inconsistencies, it can determine the source keyboard of a compromising emanation, even if multiple keyboards from the same model are used at the same time.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag2_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag2-12">[12]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The four different kinds way of compromising electromagnetic emanations are described below.\n</p>, <p>When a key is pressed, released or held down, the keyboard sends a packet of information known as a scan code to the computer.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag3_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag3-13">[13]</a></sup> The protocol used to transmit these scan codes is a bidirectional serial communication, based on four wires: Vcc (5 volts), ground, data and clock.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag3_13-1"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag3-13">[13]</a></sup> Clock and data signals are identically generated. Hence, the compromising emanation detected is the combination of both signals. However, the edges of the data and the clock lines are not superposed. Thus, they can be easily separated to obtain independent signals.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag4_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag4-14">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The Falling Edge Transition attack is limited to a partial recovery of the keystrokes. This is a significant limitation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag5_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag5-15">[15]</a></sup> The GTT is a falling edge transition attack improved, which recover almost all keystrokes. Indeed, between two traces, there is exactly one data rising edge. If attackers are able to detect this transition, they can fully recover the keystrokes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag5_15-1"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag5-15">[15]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Harmonics compromising electromagnetic emissions come from unintentional emanations such as radiations emitted by the clock, non-linear elements, crosstalk, ground pollution, etc. Determining theoretically the reasons of these compromising radiations is a very complex task.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag6_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag6-16">[16]</a></sup> These harmonics correspond to a carrier of approximately 4 MHz which is very likely the internal clock of the micro-controller inside the keyboard. These harmonics are correlated with both clock and data signals, which describe modulated signals (in amplitude and frequency) and the full state of both clock and data signals. This means that the scan code can be completely recovered from these harmonics.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag6_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag6-16">[16]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Keyboard manufacturers arrange the keys in a matrix. The keyboard controller, often an 8-bit processor, parses columns one-by-one and recovers the state of 8 keys at once. This matrix scan process can be described as 192 keys (some keys may not be used, for instance modern keyboards use 104/105 keys) arranged in 24 columns and 8 rows.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag7_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag7-17">[17]</a></sup> These columns are continuously pulsed one-by-one for at least 3\xce\xbcs. Thus, these leads may act as an antenna and generate electromagnetic emanations. If an attacker is able to capture these emanations, he can easily recover the column of the pressed key. Even if this signal does not fully describe the pressed key, it still gives partial information on the transmitted scan code, i.e. the column number.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag7_17-1"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag7-17">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Note that the matrix scan routine loops continuously. When no key is pressed, we still have a signal composed of multiple equidistant peaks. These emanations may be used to remotely detect the presence of powered computers. Concerning wireless keyboards, the wireless data burst transmission can be used as an electromagnetic trigger to detect exactly when a key is pressed, while the matrix scan emanations are used to determine the column it belongs to.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Vuag7_17-2"><a href="#cite_note-Vuag7-17">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Some techniques can only target some keyboards. This table sums up which technique could be used to find keystroke for different kind of keyboard.\n</p>, <p>In their paper called <a href="#Vuag1">"Compromising Electromagnetic Emanations of Wired and Wireless Keyboards"</a>, Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini tested 12 different keyboard models, with PS/2, USB connectors and wireless communication in different setups: a semi-anechoic chamber, a small office, an adjacent office and a flat in a building. The table below presents their results.\n</p>, <p>Attacks against emanations caused by human typing have attracted interest in recent years. In particular, works showed that keyboard acoustic emanations do leak information that can be exploited to reconstruct the typed text.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber1]_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber1]-18">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>PC keyboards, notebook keyboards are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sound emanated by different keys.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Aso1]_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Aso1]-19">[19]</a></sup> This attack takes as input an audio signal containing a recording of a single word typed by a single person on a keyboard, and a dictionary of words. It is assumed that the typed word is present in the dictionary. The aim of the attack is to reconstruct the original word from the signal.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber2]_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber2]-20">[20]</a></sup> This attack, taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Zhu1]_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Zhu1]-21">[21]</a></sup> This attack is inexpensive because the other hardware required is a parabolic microphone and non-invasive because it does not require physical intrusion into the system. The attack employs a neural network to recognize the key being pressed.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Aso1]_19-1"><a href="#cite_note-[Aso1]-19">[19]</a></sup> It combines signal processing and efficient data structures and algorithms, to successfully reconstruct single words of 7-13 characters from a recording of the clicks made when typing them on a keyboard.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber1]_18-1"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber1]-18">[18]</a></sup> The sound of clicks can differ slightly from key to key, because the keys are positioned at different positions on the keyboard plate, although the clicks of different keys sound similar to the human ear.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Aso1]_19-2"><a href="#cite_note-[Aso1]-19">[19]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>On average, there were only 0.5 incorrect recognitions per 20 clicks, which shows the exposure of keyboard to the eavesdropping using this attack.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Aso2]_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Aso2]-22">[22]</a></sup>\nThe attack is very efficient, taking under 20 seconds per word on a standard PC. A 90% or better success rate of finding the correct word for words of 10 or more characters, and a success rate of 73% over all the words tested.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber1]_18-2"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber1]-18">[18]</a></sup> In practice, a human attacker can typically determine if text is random. An attacker can also identify occasions when the user types user names and passwords.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Zhu2]_23-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Zhu2]-23">[23]</a></sup> Short audio signals containing a single word, with seven or more characters long was considered.

Such short words are often chosen as a password.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber1]_18-3"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber1]-18">[18]</a></sup> The dominant factors affecting the attack\'s success are the word length, and more importantly, the number of repeated characters within the word.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber1]_18-4"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber1]-18">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>This is a procedure that makes it possible to efficiently uncover a word out of audio recordings of keyboard click sounds.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber3]_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber3]-24">[24]</a></sup> More recently, extracting information out of an other type of emanations was demonstrated: acoustic emanations from mechanical devices such as dot-matrix printers.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-[Ber1]_18-5"><a href="#cite_note-[Ber1]-18">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>While extracting private information by watching somebody typing on a keyboard might seem to be an easy task, it becomes extremely challenging if it has to be automated. However, an automated tool is needed in the case of long-lasting surveillance procedures or long user activity, as a human being is able to reconstruct only a few characters per minute. The paper <a href="#Balz">"ClearShot: Eavesdropping on Keyboard Input from Video"</a> presents a novel approach to automatically recovering the text being typed on a keyboard, based solely on a video of the user typing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Balz1_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-Balz1-25">[25]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Automatically recognizing the keys being pressed by a user is a hard problem that requires sophisticated motion analysis.

For each frame of the video, the computer vision analysis computes the set of keys that were likely pressed, the set of keys that were certainly not pressed, and the position of space characters. Because the results of this phase of the analysis are noisy, <b>a second phase</b>, called the text analysis, is required. The goal of this phase is to remove errors using both language and context-sensitive techniques. The result of this phase is the reconstructed text, where each word is represented by a list of possible candidates, ranked by likelihood.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Balz2_26-2"><a href="#cite_note-Balz2-26">[26]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>With acoustic emanations, an attack that recovers what a dot-matrix printer processing English text is printing is possible. It is based on a record of the sound the printer makes, if the microphone is close enough to it.

Void formation leads to a local increase in current density and Joule heating (the interaction of electrons and metal ions to produce thermal energy), producing further electromigration effects. When the external stress is removed, the disturbed system tends to relax back to its original equilibrium state, resulting in a backflow which heals some of the electromigration damage.
