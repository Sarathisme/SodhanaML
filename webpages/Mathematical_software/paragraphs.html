[<p><b>Mathematical software</b> is <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> used to <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_model" title="Mathematical model">model</a>, analyze or calculate numeric, symbolic or geometric data.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>It is a type of <a href="/wiki/Application_software" title="Application software">application software</a> which is used for solving <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_problem" title="Mathematical problem">mathematical problems</a> or mathematical study. There are various views to what is the <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, so there is various views of the category of mathematical software which used for them, over from narrow to wide sense.\n</p>, <p>A type of mathematical software (<a href="/wiki/Math_library" title="Math library">math library</a>) also used by built in the part of another <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scientific_software" title="Scientific software">scientific software</a>. A most primary them (for example, to calculate <a href="/wiki/Elementary_function" title="Elementary function">elementary function</a> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Floating_point_arithmetic" title="Floating point arithmetic">floating point arithmetic</a>) may be in the category of mathematical software. They are often usually built in the general purpose systems as <a href="/wiki/Middleware" title="Middleware">middleware</a>. So to speak, mathematical software is not only an application software but also basis of another scientific software. And that is its one of the characteristic of mathematical software as that mean. <br/>\nSeveral mathematical software often have good <a href="/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a> for educational purpose (see <a href="/wiki/List_of_educational_software#Mathematics" title="List of educational software">educational math software</a>). But the core parts of solver of them <i>direct</i> dependent to the <a href="/wiki/Algorism" title="Algorism">algorism</a> by the mathematical knowledge. So it may be common sense that it does not process if it not well solved on <i>mathematical construction</i> at least. (There is physical limitation of <a href="/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a>.) That is typical difference of mathematical software for another application software.<br/>\nSpecially, It may be sure common sense that to the attention that there is a such as next case in mathematical software using:\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Numerical_analysis" title="Numerical analysis">Numerical analysis</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Symbolic_computation" title="Symbolic computation">symbolic computation</a> had been in most important place of the subject, but other kind of them is also growing now.
