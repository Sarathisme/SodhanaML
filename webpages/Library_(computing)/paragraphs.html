[<p>In <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, a <b>library</b> is a collection of <a href="/wiki/Non-volatile_memory" title="Non-volatile memory">non-volatile resources</a> used by <a href="/wiki/Computer_program" title="Computer program">computer programs</a>, often for <a href="/wiki/Software_development" title="Software development">software development</a>. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, <a href="/wiki/Code_reuse" title="Code reuse">pre-written code</a> and <a href="/wiki/Subroutine" title="Subroutine">subroutines</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_(computer_science)" title="Class (computer science)">classes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Value_(computer_science)" title="Value (computer science)">values</a> or <a href="/wiki/Data_type" title="Data type">type</a> specifications. In <a href="/wiki/OS/360_and_successors" title="OS/360 and successors">IBM\'s OS/360 and its successors</a> they are referred to as <a href="/wiki/Data_set_(IBM_mainframe)#Partitioned_datasets" title="Data set (IBM mainframe)">partitioned data sets</a>.\n</p>, <p>A <b>library</b> is also a collection of implementations of behavior, written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked. For instance, people who want to write a higher level program can use a library to make <a href="/wiki/System_call" title="System call">system calls</a> instead of implementing those system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by multiple independent programs.  A program invokes the library-provided behavior via a mechanism of the language.  For example, in a simple <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Imperative_language" title="Imperative language">imperative language</a> such as C, the behavior in a library is invoked by using C\'s normal function-call.  What distinguishes the call as being to a library function, versus being to another function in the same program, is the way that the code is organized in the system.\n</p>, <p>Library code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other, while code that is part of a program is organized to be used only within that one program.  This distinction can gain a hierarchical notion when a program grows large, such as a multi-million-line program.  In that case, there may be internal libraries that are reused by independent sub-portions of the large program.  The distinguishing feature is that a library is organized for the purposes of being reused by independent programs or sub-programs, and the user only needs to know the interface, and not the internal details of the library.\n</p>, <p>The value of a library lies in the reuse of the behavior.  When a program invokes a library, it gains the behavior implemented inside that library without having to implement that behavior itself. Libraries encourage the sharing of code in a <a href="/wiki/Modular_programming" title="Modular programming">modular</a> fashion, and ease the distribution of the code.\n</p>, <p>The behavior implemented by a library can be connected to the invoking program at different <a href="/wiki/Program_lifecycle_phase" title="Program lifecycle phase">program lifecycle phases</a>.  If the code of the library is accessed during the build of the invoking program, then the library is called a <a href="/wiki/Static_library" title="Static library">static library</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Static_Libraries_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Static_Libraries-1">[1]</a></sup>  An alternative is to build the executable of the invoking program and distribute that, independently of the library implementation.  The library behavior is connected after the executable has been invoked to be executed, either as part of the process of starting the execution, or in the middle of execution.  In this case the library is called a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dynamic_library" title="Dynamic library">dynamic library</a> (loaded at <a href="/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)" title="Run time (program lifecycle phase)">run time</a>).  A dynamic library can be loaded and linked when preparing a program for execution, by the <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a>.  Alternatively, in the middle of execution, an application may explicitly request that a module be <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_loading" title="Dynamic loading">loaded</a>.\n</p>, <p>Most <a href="/wiki/Compiled_language" title="Compiled language">compiled languages</a> have a <a href="/wiki/Standard_library" title="Standard library">standard library</a> although programmers can also create their own custom libraries. Most modern <a href="/wiki/Software_system" title="Software system">software systems</a> provide libraries that implement the majority of the system services. Such libraries have <a href="/wiki/Commoditization" title="Commoditization">commoditized</a> the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.\n</p>, <p>The earliest programming concepts analogous to libraries were intended to separate <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a> definitions from the program <a href="/wiki/Implementation" title="Implementation">implementation</a>. <a href="/wiki/JOVIAL" title="JOVIAL">JOVIAL</a> brought the "COMPOOL" (Communication Pool) concept to popular attention in 1959, although it adopted the idea from the large-system <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi_Automatic_Ground_Environment" title="Semi Automatic Ground Environment">SAGE</a> software.

The linking process is usually automatically done by a <i><a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a></i> or <i>binder</i> program that searches a set of libraries and other modules in a given order. Usually it is not considered an error if a link target can be found multiple times in a given set of libraries. Linking may be done when an executable file is created, or whenever the program is used at <a href="/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)" title="Run time (program lifecycle phase)">run time</a>.\n</p>, <p>The references being resolved may be addresses for jumps and other routine calls. They may be in the main program, or in one module depending upon another. They are resolved into fixed or relocatable addresses (from a common base) by allocating runtime memory for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Memory_segment" title="Memory segment">memory segments</a> of each module referenced.\n</p>, <p>Some programming languages may use a feature called <i>smart linking</i> whereby the linker is aware of or integrated with the compiler, such that the linker knows how external references are used, and code in a library that is never actually <i>used</i>, even though internally referenced, can be discarded from the compiled application. For example, a program that only uses integers for arithmetic, or does no arithmetic operations at all, can exclude floating-point library routines. This smart-linking feature can lead to smaller application file sizes and reduced memory usage.\n</p>, <p>Some references in a program or library module are stored in a relative or symbolic form which cannot be resolved until all code and libraries are assigned final static addresses. <i>Relocation</i> is the process of adjusting these references, and is done either by the linker or the <a href="/wiki/Loader_(computing)" title="Loader (computing)">loader</a>. In general, relocation cannot be done to individual libraries themselves because the addresses in memory may vary depending on the program using them and other libraries they are combined with. <a href="/wiki/Position-independent_code" title="Position-independent code">Position-independent code</a> avoids references to absolute addresses and therefore does not require relocation.\n</p>, <p>When linking is performed during the creation of an executable or another object file, it is known as <i>static linking</i> or <i>early binding</i>. In this case, the linking is usually done by a <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a>, but may also be done by the <a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a>. A <i>static library</i>, also known as an <i>archive</i>, is one intended to be statically linked. Originally, only static libraries existed. Static linking must be performed when any modules are recompiled.\n</p>, <p>All of the modules required by a program are sometimes statically linked and copied into the executable file. This process, and the resulting stand-alone file, is known as a <a href="/wiki/Static_build" title="Static build">static build</a> of the program.

This offers two main advantages: first, it requires making only one loader for both of them, rather than two (having the single loader is considered well worth its added complexity). Secondly, it allows the executables also to be used as shared libraries, if they have a <a href="/wiki/Symbol_table" title="Symbol table">symbol table</a>. Typical combined executable and shared library formats are <a href="/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" title="Executable and Linkable Format">ELF</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mach-O" title="Mach-O">Mach-O</a> (both in Unix) and <a href="/wiki/Portable_Executable" title="Portable Executable">PE</a> (Windows).\n</p>, <p>In some older environments such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/16-bit_Windows" title="16-bit Windows">16-bit Windows</a> or <a href="/wiki/HP_Multi-Programming_Executive" title="HP Multi-Programming Executive">MPE</a> for the <a href="/wiki/HP_3000" title="HP 3000">HP 3000</a> only stack-based data (local) was allowed in shared-library code, or other significant restrictions were placed on shared-library code.\n</p>, <p>Library code may be shared in memory by multiple <a href="/wiki/Process_(computing)" title="Process (computing)">processes</a>, as well as on disk. If virtual memory is used, processes would execute the same physical page of RAM that is mapped into the different address spaces of the processes. This has advantages. For instance, on the <a href="/wiki/OpenStep" title="OpenStep">OpenStep</a> system, applications were often only a few hundred kilobytes in size and loaded quickly; the majority of their code was located in libraries that had already been loaded for other purposes by the operating system.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

These systems make sure, by various tricks like pre-mapping the address space and reserving slots for each shared library, that code has a great probability of being shared. A third alternative is <a href="/wiki/Single-level_store" title="Single-level store">single-level store</a>, as used by the <a href="/wiki/IBM_System/38" title="IBM System/38">IBM System/38</a> and its successors.  This allows position-dependent code, but places no significant restrictions on where code can be placed or how it can be shared.\n</p>, <p>In some cases different versions of shared libraries can cause problems, especially when libraries of different versions have the same file name, and different applications installed on a system each require a specific version. Such a scenario is known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DLL_hell" title="DLL hell">DLL hell</a>, named after the Windows and OS/2 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DLL_file" title="DLL file">DLL file</a>. Most modern operating systems after 2001 have clean-up methods to eliminate such situations or use application-specific "private" libraries.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-endofdllhell_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-endofdllhell-11">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Dynamic linking or <a href="/wiki/Late_binding" title="Late binding">late binding</a> is linking performed while a program is being loaded (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Load_time" title="Load time">load time</a>) or executed (<a href="/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)" title="Run time (program lifecycle phase)">run time</a>), rather than when the executable file is created. A dynamically linked library (<a href="/wiki/Dynamic-link_library" title="Dynamic-link library">dynamic-link library</a>, or DLL, under <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Windows_(OS)" title="Windows (OS)">Windows</a> and <a href="/wiki/OS/2" title="OS/2">OS/2</a>; dynamic shared object, or DSO, under <a href="/wiki/Unix-like" title="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> systems) is a library intended for dynamic linking. Only a minimal amount of work is done by the <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a> when the executable file is created; it only records what library routines the program needs and the index names or numbers of the routines in the library. The majority of the work of linking is done at the time the application is loaded (load time) or during execution (run time). Usually, the necessary linking program, called a "dynamic linker" or "linking loader", is actually part of the underlying <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a>.  (However, it is possible, and not exceedingly difficult, to write a program that uses dynamic linking and includes its own dynamic linker, even for an operating system that itself provides no support for dynamic linking.)\n</p>, <p>Programmers originally developed dynamic linking in the <a href="/wiki/Multics" title="Multics">Multics</a> operating system, starting in 1964, and the MTS (<a href="/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System" title="Michigan Terminal System">Michigan Terminal System</a>), built in the late 1960s.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Since shared libraries on most systems do not change often, systems can compute a likely load address for each shared library on the system before it is needed and store that information in the libraries and executables. If every shared library that is loaded has undergone this process, then each will load at its predetermined address, which speeds up the process of dynamic linking. This optimization is known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prebinding" title="Prebinding">prebinding</a> in macOS and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prelinking" title="Prelinking">prelinking</a> in Linux. Disadvantages of this technique include the time required to precompute these addresses every time the shared libraries change, the inability to use <a href="/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization" title="Address space layout randomization">address space layout randomization</a>, and the requirement of sufficient virtual address space for use (a problem that will be alleviated by the adoption of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/64-bit" title="64-bit">64-bit</a> architectures, at least for the time being).\n</p>, <p>Loaders for shared libraries vary widely in functionality. Some depend on the executable storing explicit paths to the libraries. Any change to the library naming or layout of the file system will cause these systems to fail. More commonly, only the name of the library (and not the path) is stored in the executable, with the operating system supplying a method to find the library on disk, based on some algorithm.\n</p>, <p>If a shared library that an executable depends on is deleted, moved, or renamed, or if an incompatible version of the library is copied to a place that is earlier in the search, the executable would fail to load. This is called <i><a href="/wiki/Dependency_hell" title="Dependency hell">dependency hell</a></i>, existing on many platforms. The (infamous) Windows variant is commonly known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DLL_hell" title="DLL hell">DLL hell</a>.  This problem cannot occur if each version of each library is uniquely identified and each program references libraries only by their full unique identifiers.  The "DLL hell" problems with earlier Windows versions arose from using only the names of libraries, which were not guaranteed to be unique, to resolve dynamic links in programs.  (To avoid "DLL hell", later versions of Windows rely largely on options for programs to install private DLLs—essentially a partial retreat from the use of shared libraries—along with mechanisms to prevent replacement of shared system DLLs with earlier versions of them.)\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> checks the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Windows_registry" title="Windows registry">registry</a> to determine the proper place to load DLLs that implement <a href="/wiki/Component_Object_Model" title="Component Object Model">COM objects</a>, but for other DLLs it will check the directories in a defined order. First, Windows checks the directory where it loaded the program (<i>private DLL</i><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-endofdllhell_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-endofdllhell-11">[9]</a></sup>); any directories set by calling the <code>SetDllDirectory()</code> function; the System32, System, and Windows directories; then the current working directory; and finally the directories specified by the PATH <a href="/wiki/Environment_variable" title="Environment variable">environment variable</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[11]</a></sup> Applications written for the <a href="/wiki/.NET_Framework" title=".NET Framework">.NET Framework</a> framework (since 2002), also check the <a href="/wiki/Global_Assembly_Cache" title="Global Assembly Cache">Global Assembly Cache</a> as the primary store of shared dll files to remove the issue of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DLL_hell" title="DLL hell">DLL hell</a>.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/OpenStep" title="OpenStep">OpenStep</a> used a more flexible system, collecting a list of libraries from a number of known locations (similar to the PATH concept) when the system first starts. Moving libraries around causes no problems at all, although users incur a time cost when first starting the system.\n</p>, <p>Most <a href="/wiki/Unix-like" title="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> systems have a "search path" specifying file-system <a href="/wiki/Directory_(computing)" title="Directory (computing)">directories</a> in which to look for dynamic libraries. Some systems specify the default path in a <a href="/wiki/Configuration_file" title="Configuration file">configuration file</a>, others hard-code it into the dynamic loader. Some <a href="/wiki/Executable" title="Executable">executable file</a> formats can specify additional directories in which to search for libraries for a particular program. This can usually be overridden with an <a href="/wiki/Environment_variable" title="Environment variable">environment variable</a>, although it is disabled for <a href="/wiki/Setuid" title="Setuid">setuid</a> and setgid programs, so that a user can\'t force such a program to run arbitrary code with root permissions. Developers of libraries are encouraged to place their dynamic libraries in places in the default search path. On the downside, this can make installation of new libraries problematic, and these "known" locations quickly become home to an increasing number of library files, making management more complex.\n</p>, <p>Dynamic loading, a subset of dynamic linking, involves a dynamically linked library loading and unloading at <a href="/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)" title="Run time (program lifecycle phase)">run time</a> on request. Such a request may be made implicitly at <a href="/wiki/Compile_time" title="Compile time">compile time</a> or explicitly at run time. Implicit requests are made at compile time when a linker adds library references that include file paths or simply file names. Explicit requests are made when applications make direct calls to an operating system\'s API at run time.\n</p>, <p>Most operating systems that support dynamically linked libraries also support dynamically loading such libraries via a <a href="/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)" title="Run time (program lifecycle phase)">run-time</a> linker <a href="/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="Application programming interface">API</a>. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> uses the API functions <tt>LoadLibrary</tt>, <tt>LoadLibraryEx</tt>, <tt>FreeLibrary</tt> and <tt>GetProcAddress</tt> with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamic_Link_Library" title="Microsoft Dynamic Link Library">Microsoft Dynamic Link Libraries</a>; <a href="/wiki/POSIX" title="POSIX">POSIX</a>-based systems, including most UNIX and UNIX-like systems, use <tt>dlopen</tt>, <tt>dlclose</tt> and <tt>dlsym</tt>. Some development systems automate this process.\n</p>, <p>Although originally pioneered in the 1960s, dynamic linking did not reach <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> used by consumers until the late 1980s. It was generally available in some form in most operating systems by the early 1990s. During this same period, <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> (OOP) was becoming a significant part of the programming landscape. OOP with runtime binding requires additional information that traditional libraries don\'t supply. In addition to the names and entry points of the code located within, they also require a list of the objects they depend on. This is a side-effect of one of OOP\'s main advantages, inheritance, which means that parts of the complete definition of any method may be in different places. This is more than simply listing that one library requires the services of another: in a true OOP system, the libraries themselves may not be known at <a href="/wiki/Compile_time" title="Compile time">compile time</a>, and vary from system to system.\n</p>, <p>At the same time many developers worked on the idea of multi-tier programs, in which a "display" running on a desktop computer would use the services of a <a href="/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computer">mainframe</a> or <a href="/wiki/Minicomputer" title="Minicomputer">minicomputer</a> for data storage or processing. For instance, a program on a GUI-based computer would send messages to a minicomputer to return small samples of a huge dataset for display. <a href="/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" title="Remote procedure call">Remote procedure calls</a> (RPC) already handled these tasks, but there was no standard RPC system.\n</p>, <p>Soon the majority of the minicomputer and mainframe vendors instigated projects to combine the two, producing an OOP library format that could be used anywhere. Such systems were known as <b>object libraries</b>, or <b>distributed objects</b>, if they supported remote access (not all did). Microsoft\'s COM is an example of such a system for local use, DCOM a modified version that supports remote access.\n</p>, <p>For some time object libraries held the status of the "next big thing" in the programming world. There were a number of efforts to create systems that would run across platforms, and companies competed to try to get developers locked into their own system. Examples include <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>\'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/System_Object_Model" title="System Object Model">System Object Model</a> (SOM/DSOM), <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>\' <a href="/wiki/Distributed_Objects_Everywhere" title="Distributed Objects Everywhere">Distributed Objects Everywhere</a> (DOE), <a href="/wiki/NeXT" title="NeXT">NeXT</a>\'s <a href="/wiki/Portable_Distributed_Objects" title="Portable Distributed Objects">Portable Distributed Objects</a> (PDO), <a href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">Digital</a>\'s <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=ObjectBroker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="ObjectBroker (page does not exist)">ObjectBroker</a>, Microsoft\'s <a href="/wiki/Component_Object_Model" title="Component Object Model">Component Object Model</a> (COM/DCOM), and any number of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CORBA" title="CORBA">CORBA</a>-based systems.\n</p>, <p>After the inevitable cooling of marketing hype, object libraries continue to be used in both object-oriented programming and distributed information systems. <b>Class libraries</b> are the rough OOP equivalent of older types of code libraries. They contain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Class_(computer_science)" title="Class (computer science)">classes</a>, which describe characteristics and define actions (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Method_(computer_science)" title="Method (computer science)">methods</a>) that involve objects. Class libraries are used to create <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/instance" title="wikt:instance">instances</a>, or objects with their characteristics set to specific values. In some OOP languages, like <a href="/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>, the distinction is clear, with the classes often contained in library files (like Java\'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jar_(file_format)" title="Jar (file format)">JAR file format</a>) and the instantiated objects residing only in memory (although potentially able to be made <a href="/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)" title="Persistence (computer science)">persistent</a> in separate files). In others, like <a href="/wiki/Smalltalk" title="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, the class libraries are merely the starting point for a <a href="/wiki/System_image" title="System image">system image</a> that includes the entire state of the environment, classes and all instantiated objects.\n</p>, <p>Another solution to the library issue comes from using completely separate executables (often in some lightweight form) and calling them using a <a href="/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" title="Remote procedure call">remote procedure call</a> (RPC) over a network to another computer. This approach maximizes operating system re-use: the code needed to support the library is the same code being used to provide application support and security for every other program. Additionally, such systems do not require the library to exist on the same machine, but can forward the requests over the network.\n</p>, <p>However, such an approach means that every library call requires a considerable amount of overhead. RPC calls are much more expensive than calling a shared library that has already been loaded on the same machine. This approach is commonly used in a <a href="/wiki/Distributed_computing" title="Distributed computing">distributed architecture</a> that makes heavy use of such remote calls, notably client-server systems and <a href="/wiki/Application_server" title="Application server">application servers</a> such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBean" title="Enterprise JavaBean">Enterprise JavaBeans</a>.\n</p>, <p>Code generation libraries are high-level <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Application_Programming_Interface" title="Application Programming Interface">APIs</a> that can generate or transform <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Byte_code" title="Byte code">byte code</a> for <a href="/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>.

Some systems might have multiple names for the dynamically linked library, with most of the names being names for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Symbolic_links" title="Symbolic links">symbolic links</a> to the remaining name; those names might include the major version of the library, or the full version number; for example, on some systems <code>libfoo.so.2</code> would be the filename for the second major interface revision of the dynamically linked library <code>libfoo</code>.  The <code>.la</code> files sometimes found in the library directories are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Libtool" title="Libtool">libtool</a> archives, not usable by the system as such.\n</p>, <p>The system inherits static library conventions from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/BSD" title="BSD">BSD</a>, with the library stored in a <code>.a</code> file, and can use <code>.so</code>-style dynamically linked libraries (with the <code>.dylib</code> suffix instead). Most libraries in macOS, however, consist of "frameworks", placed inside special directories called "<a href="/wiki/Bundle_(macOS)" title="Bundle (macOS)">bundles</a>" which wrap the library\'s required files and metadata. For example, a framework called <code>MyFramework</code> would be implemented in a bundle called <code>MyFramework.framework</code>, with <code>MyFramework.framework/MyFramework</code> being either the dynamically linked library file or being a symlink to the dynamically linked library file in <code>MyFramework.framework/Versions/Current/MyFramework</code>.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Dynamic-link_library" title="Dynamic-link library">Dynamic-link libraries</a> usually have the suffix <code>*.DLL</code>,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[13]</a></sup> although other file name extensions may identify specific-purpose dynamically linked libraries, e.g. <code>*.OCX</code> for <a href="/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding" title="Object Linking and Embedding">OLE</a> libraries. The interface revisions are either encoded in the file names, or abstracted away using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Component_object_model" title="Component object model">COM-object</a> interfaces.
