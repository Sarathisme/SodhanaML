[<p><b>Computational chemistry</b> is a branch of <a href="/wiki/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> that uses <a href="/wiki/Computer_simulation" title="Computer simulation">computer simulation</a> to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of <a href="/wiki/Theoretical_chemistry" title="Theoretical chemistry">theoretical chemistry</a>, incorporated into efficient <a href="/wiki/Computer_program" title="Computer program">computer programs</a>, to calculate the structures and properties of <a href="/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a> and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (<a href="/wiki/Dihydrogen_cation" title="Dihydrogen cation">dihydrogen cation</a>, see references therein for more details), the quantum <a href="/wiki/Many-body_problem" title="Many-body problem">many-body problem</a> cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical <a href="/wiki/Experiment" title="Experiment">experiments</a>, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Phenomena" title="Phenomena">phenomena</a>. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.\n</p>, <p>Examples of such properties are structure (i.e., the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and <a href="/wiki/Interaction_energy" title="Interaction energy">relative</a> (interaction) <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electronic</a> <a href="/wiki/Charge_density" title="Charge density">charge density</a> distributions, <a href="/wiki/Dipole" title="Dipole">dipoles</a> and higher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multipole_moment" title="Multipole moment">multipole moments</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vibrational_spectroscopy" title="Vibrational spectroscopy">vibrational frequencies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)" title="Reactivity (chemistry)">reactivity</a>, or other <a href="/wiki/Spectroscopy" title="Spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> quantities, and <a href="/wiki/Cross_section_(physics)" title="Cross section (physics)">cross sections</a> for <a href="/wiki/Scattering_theory" title="Scattering theory">collision</a> with other particles.\n</p>, <p>The methods used cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be one molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from very approximate to highly accurate; the latter are usually feasible for small systems only. <a href="/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods" title="Ab initio quantum chemistry methods"><i>Ab initio</i> methods</a> are based entirely on <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> and basic <a href="/wiki/Physical_constant" title="Physical constant">physical constants</a>. Other methods are called empirical or <a href="/wiki/Semi-empirical_quantum_chemistry_method" title="Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method">semi-empirical</a> because they use additional empirical parameters.\n</p>, <p>Both <i><a href="/wiki/Ab_initio" title="Ab initio">ab initio</a></i> and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, <a href="/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions" title="Periodic boundary conditions">periodic boundary conditions</a>), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most <i>ab initio</i> calculations make the <a href="/wiki/Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation" title="Born\xe2\x80\x93Oppenheimer approximation">Born\xe2\x80\x93Oppenheimer approximation</a>, which greatly simplifies the underlying <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation">Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation</a> by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation.  In principle, <a href="/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods" title="Ab initio quantum chemistry methods"><i>ab initio</i> methods</a> eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced.  In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains.  The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.\n</p>, <p>In some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time <a href="/wiki/Phase_space" title="Phase space">phase space</a> behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy_surface" title="Potential energy surface">potential energy surface</a> are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_dynamics" title="Molecular dynamics">molecular dynamics</a>. Furthermore, <a href="/wiki/Cheminformatics" title="Cheminformatics">cheminformatics</a> uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like <a href="/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine learning">machine learning</a> based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.\n</p>, <p>Building on the founding discoveries and theories in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics" title="History of quantum mechanics">history of quantum mechanics</a>, the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of <a href="/wiki/Walter_Heitler" title="Walter Heitler">Walter Heitler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fritz_London" title="Fritz London">Fritz London</a> in 1927.

In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were performed. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. One major advance came with the 1951 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics by Clemens C. J. Roothaan in 1951, largely on the "LCAO MO" approach (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals Molecular Orbitals), for many years the second-most cited paper in that journal.

In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for <a href="/wiki/Chemical_reaction" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reactions</a>. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.\n</p>, <p>Computational chemistry has two different aspects:\n</p>, <p>Thus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.\n</p>, <p>Several major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:\n</p>, <p>The words <i>exact</i> and <i>perfect</i> do not apply here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.\n</p>, <p>Molecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation">Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation</a>, with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic <a href="/wiki/Dirac_equation" title="Dirac equation">Dirac equation</a>. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.\n</p>, <p>Accuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in <a href="/wiki/Ab_initio" title="Ab initio">ab initio</a> models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of small molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with errors for energies less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen atoms is computationally tractable by more approximate methods such as <a href="/wiki/Density_functional_theory" title="Density functional theory">density functional theory</a> (DFT).\n</p>, <p>There is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by <a href="/wiki/Classical_mechanics" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a> methods that use what are called <a href="/wiki/Molecular_mechanics" title="Molecular mechanics">molecular mechanics</a> (MM).  In QM-MM methods, small parts of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).\n</p>, <p>One molecular formula can represent more than one molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy_surface" title="Potential energy surface">potential energy surface</a>) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a <a href="/wiki/Transition_state" title="Transition state">transition structure</a> and the coordinate is the <a href="/wiki/Reaction_coordinate" title="Reaction coordinate">reaction coordinate</a>. This process of determining stationary points is called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geometry_optimization" title="Geometry optimization">geometry optimization</a>.\n</p>, <p>The determination of molecular structure by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geometry_optimization" title="Geometry optimization">geometry optimization</a> became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the <a href="/wiki/Hessian_matrix" title="Hessian matrix">Hessian matrix</a>, which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.\n</p>, <p>The total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the <a href="/wiki/Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation" title="Born\xe2\x80\x93Oppenheimer approximation">Born\xe2\x80\x93Oppenheimer approximation</a>, which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called <a href="/wiki/Direct_quantum_chemistry" title="Direct quantum chemistry">direct quantum chemistry</a>, which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:\n</p>, <p>The programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different <a href="/wiki/Quantum_chemistry" title="Quantum chemistry">quantum-chemical</a> methods that solve the molecular <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation">Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation</a> associated with the <a href="/wiki/Molecular_Hamiltonian" title="Molecular Hamiltonian">molecular Hamiltonian</a>. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations \xe2\x80\x93 being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data \xe2\x80\x93 are called <i><a href="/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods" title="Ab initio quantum chemistry methods">ab initio methods</a></i>. This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Word_length" title="Word length">word length</a> on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).\n</p>, <p>The simplest type of <i>ab initio</i> electronic structure calculation is the <a href="/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method" title="Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock method">Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock method</a> (HF), an extension of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_orbital_theory" title="Molecular orbital theory">molecular orbital theory</a>, in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed <a href="/wiki/Post-Hartree%E2%80%93Fock" title="Post-Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock">post-Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock</a> methods) begin with a Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as <a href="/wiki/Electronic_correlation" title="Electronic correlation">electronic correlation</a>. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum_coupling#Spin-orbit_coupling" title="Angular momentum coupling">spin orbit</a> terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a <a href="/wiki/Basis_set_(chemistry)" title="Basis set (chemistry)">basis set</a>. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the <a href="/wiki/Linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals" title="Linear combination of atomic orbitals">linear combination of atomic orbitals</a> (LCAO) molecular orbital method <a href="/wiki/Ansatz" title="Ansatz">ansatz</a>. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.\n</p>, <p>The Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is inadequate, and several <a href="/wiki/Multi-configurational_self-consistent_field" title="Multi-configurational self-consistent field">configurations</a> must be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations, and of the basis functions, are optimized together.\n</p>, <p>The total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the <a href="/wiki/Molecular_geometry" title="Molecular geometry">molecular geometry</a>; in other words, the <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy_surface" title="Potential energy surface">potential energy surface</a>. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different <a href="/wiki/Isomer" title="Isomer">isomers</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Transition_state_theory" title="Transition state theory">transition structures</a> for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.\n</p>, <p>A particularly important objective, called computational <a href="/wiki/Thermochemistry" title="Thermochemistry">thermochemistry</a>, is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Standard_enthalpy_change_of_formation" title="Standard enthalpy change of formation">enthalpy of formation</a> to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1 kcal/mol or 4 kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called <a href="/wiki/Quantum_chemistry_composite_methods" title="Quantum chemistry composite methods">quantum chemistry composite methods</a>.\n</p>, <p>Density functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be <i><a href="/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods" title="Ab initio quantum chemistry methods">ab initio methods</a></i> for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common <a href="/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)" title="Functional (mathematics)">functionals</a> use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-<a href="/wiki/Electronic_density" title="Electronic density">electron density</a> rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate <a href="/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)">Hamiltonian</a> and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock exchange term and are termed <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_functional" title="Hybrid functional">hybrid functional</a> methods.\n</p>, <p>Semi-empirical <a href="/wiki/Quantum_chemistry" title="Quantum chemistry">quantum chemistry</a> methods are based on the <a href="/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method" title="Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock method">Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock method</a> formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They were very important in computational chemistry from the 60s to the 90s, especially for treating large molecules where the full Hartree\xe2\x80\x93Fock method without the approximations were too costly. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.\n</p>, <p>Primitive semi-empirical methods were designed even before, where the two-electron part of the <a href="/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)">Hamiltonian</a> is not explicitly included.

In general, the <a href="/wiki/Potential_energy_surface" title="Potential energy surface">potential energy surfaces</a> are coupled via the <a href="/wiki/Vibronic_coupling" title="Vibronic coupling">vibronic coupling</a> terms.\n</p>, <p>The most popular methods for propagating the <a href="/wiki/Wave_packet" title="Wave packet">wave packet</a> associated to the <a href="/wiki/Molecular_geometry" title="Molecular geometry">molecular geometry</a> are:\n</p>, <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) use either <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molecular_mechanics" title="Molecular mechanics">molecular mechanics</a> or a <a href="/wiki/QM/MM" title="QM/MM">mixture of both</a> to calculate forces which are then used to solve <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newton\'s laws of motion</a> to examine the time-dependent behaviour of systems. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory that describes how the position and velocity of particles varies with time.\n</p>, <p>QM/MM is a hybrid method that attempts to combine the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the speed of molecular mechanics. It is useful for simulating very large molecules such as <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a>.\n</p>, <p>The <a href="/wiki/Atoms_in_molecules" title="Atoms in molecules">atoms in molecules</a> (QTAIM) model of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Bader" title="Richard Bader">Richard Bader</a> was developed to effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lewis_pair" title="Lewis pair">Lewis pairs</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Valence_bond_theory" title="Valence bond theory">valence bond model</a>. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts can be related to the <a href="/wiki/Topology" title="Topology">topology</a> of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the <a href="/wiki/AIMAll" title="AIMAll">AIMAll</a> software package.\n</p>, <p>Many self-sufficient <a href="/wiki/Category:Computational_chemistry_software" title="Category:Computational chemistry software">computational chemistry software packages</a> exist. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrate on a very specific range or even on one method. Details of most of them can be found in:\n</p>]
