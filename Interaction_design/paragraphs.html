[<p><b>Interaction design</b>, often abbreviated as <b>IxD</b>, is "the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-AboutFace3_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-AboutFace3-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>xxxi,1</span></sup> Beyond the digital aspect, interaction design is also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it.

Cooper introduces the concept of cognitive friction, which is when the interface of a design is complex and difficult to use, and behaves inconsistently and unexpectedly, possessing different modes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Inmates_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-Inmates-9">[9]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>22</span></sup>\n</p>, <p>Alternatively, interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the service/product provider.

Jacob Nielsen describes usability as the quality attribute <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> that describes how usable the interface is.

Cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality, rather than an in-depth, detailed description. They provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation, <a href="/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a> or programming language design.\n</p>, <p>Dimensions provide high-level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it: examples include <i>consistency</i>, <i>error-proneness</i>, <i>hard mental operations</i>, <i>viscosity</i> and <i>premature commitment</i>.

One method that can help convey such aspects is for example, the use of dynamic icons, animations and sound to help communicate, creating a sense of interactivity. Interface aspects such as fonts, color palettes and graphical layouts can influence acceptance.
