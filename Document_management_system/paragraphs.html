[<p>A <b>document management system</b> (<b>DMS</b>) is a system (based on computer programs in the case of the management of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_document" title="Digital document">digital documents</a>) used to track, manage and store documents and reduce paper. Most are capable of keeping a record of the various versions created and modified by different users (history tracking). The term has some overlap with the concepts of <a href="/wiki/Content_management_system" title="Content management system">content management systems</a>. It is often viewed as a component of <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_content_management" title="Enterprise content management">enterprise content management</a> (ECM) systems and related to <a href="/wiki/Digital_asset_management" title="Digital asset management">digital asset management</a>, <a href="/wiki/Document_imaging" title="Document imaging">document imaging</a>, <a href="/wiki/Workflow" title="Workflow">workflow</a> systems and <a href="/wiki/Records_management" title="Records management">records management</a> systems.\n</p>, <p><br/>\n</p>, <p>Beginning in the 1980s, a number of vendors began to develop software systems to manage paper-based documents. These systems dealt with <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Paper_document&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Paper document (page does not exist)">paper documents</a>, which included not only printed and published documents, but also <a href="/wiki/Photograph" title="Photograph">photographs</a>, prints, etc...\n</p>, <p>Later developers began to write a second type of system which could manage <a href="/wiki/Electronic_document" title="Electronic document">electronic documents</a>, i.e., all those documents, or files, created on computers, and often stored on users\' local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/File-system" title="File-system">file-systems</a>. The earliest electronic document management (EDM) systems managed either proprietary file types, or a limited number of <a href="/wiki/File_format" title="File format">file formats</a>.  Many of these systems later<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous.

EDM systems evolved to a point where systems could manage any type of file format that could be stored on the network. The applications grew to encompass electronic documents, <a href="/wiki/Collaboration_tool" title="Collaboration tool">collaboration tools</a>, security, workflow, and <a href="/wiki/Audit" title="Audit">auditing</a> capabilities.\n</p>, <p>These systems enabled an organization to capture faxes and forms, to save copies of the documents as images, and to store the image files in the <a href="/wiki/Information_repository" title="Information repository">repository</a> for security and quick retrieval (retrieval made possible because the system handled the extraction of the text from the document in the process of capture, and the text-indexer function provided <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Text_retrieval" title="Text retrieval">text-retrieval</a> capabilities).\n</p>, <p>While many EDM systems store documents in their native file format (Microsoft Word or Excel, PDF), some web-based document management systems are beginning to store content in the form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Html" title="Html">html</a>. These policy management systems<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> require content to be imported into the system. However, once content is imported, the software (ex. Corona Document Management System) acts like a search engine so users can find what they are looking for faster. The html format allows for better application of search capabilities such as full-text searching and stemming.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Document management systems commonly provide storage, versioning, metadata, security, as well as indexing and retrieval capabilities. Here is a description of these components:\n</p>, <p>The published document should be in a format that is not easily altered without a specific knowledge or tools, and yet it is read-only or portable.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sdmv_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-sdmv-17">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Many industry associations publish their own lists of particular document control standards that are used in their particular field. Following is a list of some of the relevant ISO documents. Divisions ICS 01.140.10 and 01.140.20.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-wt_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-wt-19">[19]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-is_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-is-20">[20]</a></sup> The ISO has also published a series of standards regarding the <a href="/wiki/Technical_documentation" title="Technical documentation">technical documentation</a>, covered by the division of 01.110.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-tpd_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-tpd-21">[21]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Government regulations require that companies working in certain industries control their documents. These industries include accounting (for example: 8th <a href="/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)" title="Directive (European Union)">EU Directive</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act" title="Sarbanes\xe2\x80\x93Oxley Act">Sarbanes\xe2\x80\x93Oxley Act</a>), food safety (e.g., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Food_Safety_Modernization_Act" title="Food Safety Modernization Act">Food Safety Modernization Act</a>), ISO (mentioned above), medical-device manufacturing (<a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</a>), manufacture of blood, human cells, and tissue products (FDA), healthcare (<i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/JCAHO" title="JCAHO">JCAHO</a></i>), and information technology (<i><a href="/wiki/ITIL" title="ITIL">ITIL</a></i>).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>\nSome industries work under stricter document control requirements due to the type of information they retain for privacy, warranty, or other highly regulated purposes. Examples include <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Protected_Health_Information" title="Protected Health Information">Protected Health Information</a> (PHI) as required by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/HIPAA" title="HIPAA">HIPAA</a> or construction project documents required for warranty periods. An information systems strategy plan (ISSP) can shape organisational information systems over medium to long-term periods.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Documents stored in a document management system\xe2\x80\x94such as procedures, work instructions, and policy statements\xe2\x80\x94provide evidence of documents under control. Failing to comply can cause fines, the loss of business, or damage to a business\'s reputation.\n</p>, <p>The following are important aspects of document control:\n</p>, <p><b>Integrated document management</b> comprises the technologies, tools, and methods used to capture, manage, store, preserve, deliver and dispose of \'documents\' across an enterprise. In this context \'documents\' are any of a myriad of information assets including images, office documents, graphics, and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as Web pages, email, instant messages, and video.\n</p>, <p>Paper documents have long been used in storing <a href="/wiki/Information" title="Information">information</a>. However, paper can be costly and, if used excessively, wasteful. Document management software is not simply a tool but it lets a user manage access, track and edit information stored. Document management software is an <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronic</a> cabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The software helps the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Businesses" title="Businesses">businesses</a> to combine paper to digital files and store it into a single hub after it is scanned and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_formats" title="Digital formats">digital formats</a> gets imported.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_based" title="Web based">Web based</a> document management software are becoming the staple of the <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a>.
