Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Experimental_study" title="Experimental study">experimental study</a> involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an <a href="/wiki/Observational_study" title="Observational study">observational study</a> does not involve experimental manipulation.\n</p>, <p>Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: <a href="/wiki/Descriptive_statistics" title="Descriptive statistics">descriptive statistics</a>, which summarize data from a sample using <a href="/wiki/Index_(statistics)" title="Index (statistics)">indexes</a> such as the <a href="/wiki/Mean" title="Mean">mean</a> or <a href="/wiki/Standard_deviation" title="Standard deviation">standard deviation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Statistical_inference" title="Statistical inference">inferential statistics</a>, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-LundResearchLtd_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-LundResearchLtd-3">[3]</a></sup> Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a <i>distribution</i> (sample or population): <i><a href="/wiki/Central_tendency" title="Central tendency">central tendency</a></i> (or <i>location</i>) seeks to characterize the distribution\'s central or typical value, while <i><a href="/wiki/Statistical_dispersion" title="Statistical dispersion">dispersion</a></i> (or <i>variability</i>) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other.

Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Type_I_error" title="Type I error">Type I errors</a> (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Type_II_error" title="Type II error">Type II errors</a> (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative").<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Populations can be diverse topics such as "all persons living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal".\n</p>, <p>Ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population (an operation called <a href="/wiki/Census" title="Census">census</a>). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. <i><a href="/wiki/Descriptive_statistics" title="Descriptive statistics">Descriptive statistics</a></i> can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include <a href="/wiki/Mean" title="Mean">mean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Standard_deviation" title="Standard deviation">standard deviation</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Continuous_probability_distribution" title="Continuous probability distribution">continuous data</a> types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Categorical_data" title="Categorical data">categorical data</a> (like race).\n</p>, <p>When a census is not feasible, a chosen subset of the population called a <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)" title="Sampling (statistics)">sample</a> is studied. Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or <a href="/wiki/Experiment" title="Experiment">experimental</a> setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inferential_statistics" title="Inferential statistics">inferential statistics</a></i> is needed. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hypothesis_testing" title="Hypothesis testing">hypothesis testing</a>), estimating numerical characteristics of the data (<a href="/wiki/Estimation_theory" title="Estimation theory">estimation</a>), describing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Association_(statistics)" title="Association (statistics)">associations</a> within the data (<a href="/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence" title="Correlation and dependence">correlation</a>) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using <a href="/wiki/Regression_analysis" title="Regression analysis">regression analysis</a>).

Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through <a href="/wiki/Statistical_model" title="Statistical model">statistical models</a>. The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)" title="Sampling (statistics)">sampling</a> assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.\n</p>, <p>Sampling theory is part of the <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematical discipline</a> of <a href="/wiki/Probability_theory" title="Probability theory">probability theory</a>. Probability is used in <a href="/wiki/Statistical_theory" title="Statistical theory">mathematical statistics</a> to study the <a href="/wiki/Sampling_distribution" title="Sampling distribution">sampling distributions</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sample_statistic" title="Sample statistic">sample statistics</a> and, more generally, the properties of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statistical_decision_theory" title="Statistical decision theory">statistical procedures</a>. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method.\nThe difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to <a href="/wiki/Deductive_reasoning" title="Deductive reasoning">deduce</a> probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction\xe2\x80\x94<a href="/wiki/Inductive_reasoning" title="Inductive reasoning">inductively inferring</a> from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.\n</p>, <p>A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate <a href="/wiki/Causality" title="Causality">causality</a>, and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or <a href="/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables" title="Dependent and independent variables">independent variables on dependent variables</a>. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: <a href="/wiki/Experiment" title="Experiment">experimental studies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Observational_study" title="Observational study">observational studies</a>. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.\nAn experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve <a href="/wiki/Scientific_control" title="Scientific control">experimental manipulation</a>. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.\nWhile the tools of data analysis work best on data from <a href="/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial" title="Randomized controlled trial">randomized studies</a>, they are also applied to other kinds of data\xe2\x80\x94like <a href="/wiki/Natural_experiment" title="Natural experiment">natural experiments</a> and <a href="/wiki/Observational_study" title="Observational study">observational studies</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>\xe2\x80\x94for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Difference_in_differences" title="Difference in differences">Difference in differences estimation</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instrumental_variable" title="Instrumental variable">instrumental variables</a>, among many others) that produce <a href="/wiki/Consistent_estimator" title="Consistent estimator">consistent estimators</a>.\n</p>, <p>The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:\n</p>, <p>Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hawthorne_study" title="Hawthorne study">Hawthorne study</a> examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Western_Electric_Company" title="Western Electric Company">Western Electric Company</a>. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the <a href="/wiki/Assembly_line" title="Assembly line">assembly line</a> workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Control_group" title="Control group">control group</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Double-blind" title="Double-blind">blindness</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Hawthorne_effect" title="Hawthorne effect">Hawthorne effect</a> refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-pmid17608932_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid17608932-16">[16]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a <a href="/wiki/Cohort_study" title="Cohort study">cohort study</a>, and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Case-control_study" title="Case-control study">case-control study</a> is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.\n</p>, <p>Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of <a href="/wiki/Level_of_measurement" title="Level of measurement">levels of measurement</a>. The psychophysicist <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Smith_Stevens" title="Stanley Smith Stevens">Stanley Smith Stevens</a> defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with <a href="/wiki/Longitude" title="Longitude">longitude</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> measurements in <a href="/wiki/Celsius" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> or <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" title="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a>), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.\n</p>, <p>Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as <a href="/wiki/Categorical_variable" title="Categorical variable">categorical variables</a>, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as <a href="/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)#Applied_statistics" title="Variable (mathematics)">quantitative variables</a>, which can be either <a href="/wiki/Probability_distribution#Discrete_probability_distribution" title="Probability distribution">discrete</a> or <a href="/wiki/Probability_distribution#Continuous_probability_distribution" title="Probability distribution">continuous</a>, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with <a href="/wiki/Data_type" title="Data type">data type</a> in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the <a href="/wiki/Boolean_data_type" title="Boolean data type">Boolean data type</a>, polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned <a href="/wiki/Integer" title="Integer">integers</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)" title="Integer (computer science)">integral data type</a>, and continuous variables with the <a href="/wiki/Real_data_type" title="Real data type">real data type</a> involving <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Floating_point" title="Floating point">floating point</a> computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.\n</p>, <p>Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data.

Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confidence_intervals" title="Confidence intervals">Confidence intervals</a> allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does <i>not</i> imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the <a href="/wiki/Frequentist_inference" title="Frequentist inference">frequentist</a> perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a <a href="/wiki/Random_variable" title="Random variable">random variable</a>.  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed <a href="/wiki/Random_variable" title="Random variable">random variables</a>. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a <a href="/wiki/Credible_interval" title="Credible interval">credible interval</a> from <a href="/wiki/Bayesian_statistics" title="Bayesian statistics">Bayesian statistics</a>: this approach depends on a different way of <a href="/wiki/Probability_interpretations" title="Probability interpretations">interpreting what is meant by "probability"</a>, that is as a <a href="/wiki/Bayesian_probability" title="Bayesian probability">Bayesian probability</a>.\n</p>, <p>In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.\n</p>, <p>Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the <a href="/wiki/P-value" title="P-value">p-value</a>).\n</p>, <p>The standard approach<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Piazza_23-1"><a href="#cite_note-Piazza-23">[23]</a></sup> is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Critical_region#Definition_of_terms" title="Critical region">critical region</a> is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true (<a href="/wiki/Statistical_significance" title="Statistical significance">statistical significance</a>) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn\'t belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statistical_power" title="Statistical power">statistical power</a> of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.\n</p>, <p>Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.\n</p>, <p>Although in principle the acceptable level of <a href="/wiki/Statistical_significance" title="Statistical significance">statistical significance</a> may be subject to debate, the <a href="/wiki/P-value" title="P-value">p-value</a> is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the <a href="/wiki/Test_statistic" title="Test statistic">test statistic</a>. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.\n</p>, <p>Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See <a href="/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Criticism" title="Statistical hypothesis testing">criticism of hypothesis testing</a>):\n</p>, <p>Some well-known statistical <a href="/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing" title="Statistical hypothesis testing">tests</a> and <a href="/wiki/Procedure_(term)" title="Procedure (term)">procedures</a> are:\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Misuse_of_statistics" title="Misuse of statistics">Misuse of statistics</a> can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretation\xe2\x80\x94subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors.

Statistical analysis of a <a href="/wiki/Data_set" title="Data set">data set</a> often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confounding_variable" title="Confounding variable">confounding variable</a>.
