[<p><b>Network performance</b> refers to measures of <a href="/wiki/Service_quality" title="Service quality">service quality</a> of a network as seen by the customer.\n</p>, <p>There are many different ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled and simulated instead of measured; one example of this is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance or to use a Network Simulator.\n</p>, <p>The following measures are often considered important:\n</p>, <p>The available channel bandwidth and achievable signal-to-noise ratio determine the maximum possible throughput. It is not generally possible to send more data than dictated by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shannon-Hartley_Theorem" title="Shannon-Hartley Theorem">Shannon-Hartley Theorem</a>.\n</p>, <p><i>Throughput</i> is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time. Throughput is controlled by available bandwidth, as well as the available signal-to-noise ratio and hardware limitations. Throughput for the purpose of this article will be understood to be measured from the arrival of the first bit of data at the receiver, to decouple the concept of throughput from the concept of latency. For discussions of this type the terms \'throughput\' and \'bandwidth\' are often used interchangeably.\n</p>, <p>The <i>Time Window</i> is the period over which the throughput is measured. Choice of an appropriate time window will often dominate calculations of throughput, and whether latency is taken into account or not will determine whether the latency affects the throughput or not.\n</p>, <p>The <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a> imposes a minimum propagation time on all electromagnetic signals. It is not possible to reduce the latency below\n</p>, <p>where s is the distance and c<sub>m</sub> is the speed of light in the medium. This approximately means 1 extra millisecond roundtrip time (RTT) for 100 km/62miles of distance between hosts.\n</p>, <p>Other delays also occur in intermediate nodes. In packet switched networks delays can occur due to queueing.\n</p>, <p><b>Jitter</b> is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Signalling_(telecommunication)" title="Signalling (telecommunication)">signal</a> in <a href="/wiki/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telecommunications" title="Telecommunications">telecommunications</a>, often in relation to a reference <a href="/wiki/Clock_signal" title="Clock signal">clock source</a>. Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the <a href="/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> of successive pulses, the signal <a href="/wiki/Amplitude" title="Amplitude">amplitude</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Phase_(waves)" title="Phase (waves)">phase</a> of periodic signals. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., <a href="/wiki/USB" title="USB">USB</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PCI-e" title="PCI-e">PCI-e</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SATA" title="SATA">SATA</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/OC-48" title="OC-48">OC-48</a>). In <a href="/wiki/Clock_recovery" title="Clock recovery">clock recovery</a> applications it is called <i>timing jitter</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-wol91p211_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-wol91p211-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digital_transmission" title="Digital transmission">digital transmission</a>, the number of <b>bit errors</b> is the number of received <a href="/wiki/Bit" title="Bit">bits</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Data_stream" title="Data stream">data stream</a> over a <a href="/wiki/Communication_channel" title="Communication channel">communication channel</a> that have been altered due to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Noise_(telecommunications)" title="Noise (telecommunications)">noise</a>, <a href="/wiki/Interference_(communication)" title="Interference (communication)">interference</a>, <a href="/wiki/Distortion" title="Distortion">distortion</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bit_synchronization" title="Bit synchronization">bit synchronization</a> errors.\n</p>, <p>The <b>bit error rate</b> or <b>bit error ratio</b> (<b>BER</b>) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. BER is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a <a href="/wiki/Percentage" title="Percentage">percentage</a>.\n</p>, <p>The <b>bit error probability</b> <i>p<sub>e</sub></i> is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Expectation_value" title="Expectation value">expectation value</a> of the BER. The BER can be considered as an approximate estimate of the bit error probability. This estimate is accurate for a long time interval and a high number of bit errors.\n</p>, <p>All of the factors above, coupled with user requirements and user perceptions, play a role in determining the perceived \'fastness\' or utility, of a network connection. The relationship between throughput, latency, and user experience is most aptly understood in the context of a shared network medium, and as a scheduling problem.\n</p>, <p>For some systems, latency and throughput are coupled entities. In TCP/IP, latency can also directly affect throughput. In <a href="/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol" title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</a> connections, the large <a href="/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product" title="Bandwidth-delay product">bandwidth-delay product</a> of high latency connections, combined with relatively small TCP window sizes on many devices, effectively causes the throughput of a high latency connection to drop sharply with latency. This can be remedied with various techniques, such as increasing the TCP congestion window size, or more drastic solutions, such as packet coalescing, <a href="/wiki/TCP_acceleration" title="TCP acceleration">TCP acceleration</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Forward_error_correction" title="Forward error correction">forward error correction</a>, all of which are commonly used for high latency satellite links.\n</p>, <p>TCP acceleration converts the TCP packets into a stream that is similar to <a href="/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol" title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</a>. Because of this, the TCP acceleration software must provide its own mechanisms to ensure the reliability of the link, taking the latency and bandwidth of the link into account, and both ends of the high latency link must support the method used.\n</p>, <p>In the Media Access Control (MAC) layer, performance issues such as throughput and end-to-end delay are also addressed.\n</p>, <p>Many systems can be characterized as dominated either by throughput limitations or by latency limitations in terms of end-user utility or experience. In some cases, hard limits such as the speed of light present unique problems to such systems and nothing can be done to correct this. Other systems allow for significant balancing and optimization for best user experience.\n</p>, <p>A telecom satellite in geosynchronous orbit imposes a path length of at least 71000 km between transmitter and receiver.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> which means a minimum delay between message request and message receipt, or latency of 473 ms. This delay can be very noticeable and affects satellite phone service regardless of available throughput capacity.\n</p>, <p>These long path length considerations are exacerbated when communicating with space probes and other long-range targets beyond Earth\'s atmosphere. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deep_Space_Network" title="Deep Space Network">Deep Space Network</a> implemented by NASA is one such system that must cope with these problems. Largely latency driven, the GAO has criticized the current architecture.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Several different methods have been proposed to handle the intermittent connectivity and long delays between packets, such as <a href="/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking" title="Delay-tolerant networking">delay-tolerant networking</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>At interstellar distances, the difficulties in designing radio systems that can achieve any throughput at all are massive. In these cases, maintaining communication is a bigger issue than how long that communication takes.\n</p>, <p>Transportation is concerned almost entirely with throughput, which is why physical deliveries of backup tape archives are still largely done by vehicle.\n</p>]
