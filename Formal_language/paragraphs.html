Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of <a href="/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">natural languages</a>.\nIn computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of <a href="/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or <a href="/wiki/Semantics" title="Semantics">semantics</a>.

The elements of an alphabet are called its <b>letters</b>.  An alphabet may contain an <a href="/wiki/Countable_set" title="Countable set">infinite</a> number of elements;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and most results apply only to them.\n</p>, <p>A <b>word</b> over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., <a href="/wiki/String_(computer_science)" title="String (computer science)">string</a>) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet \xce\xa3 is usually denoted by \xce\xa3<sup>*</sup> (using the <a href="/wiki/Kleene_star" title="Kleene star">Kleene star</a>). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the <i>empty word</i>, which is often denoted by e, \xce\xb5, \xce\xbb or even \xce\x9b. By <a href="/wiki/Concatenation" title="Concatenation">concatenation</a> one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.\n</p>, <p>In some applications, especially in <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a>, the alphabet is also known as the <i>vocabulary</i> and words are known as <i>formulas</i> or <i>sentences</i>; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.\n</p>, <p>A <b>formal language</b> <i>L</i> over an alphabet \xce\xa3 is a <a href="/wiki/Subset" title="Subset">subset</a> of \xce\xa3<sup>*</sup>, that is, a set of <a href="#Words_over_an_alphabet">words</a> over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of \'well-formed expressions\'.\n</p>, <p>In computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with <a href="/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">natural languages</a>, the adjective "formal" is often omitted as redundant.\n</p>, <p>While formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept "formal language" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less.  In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as <a href="/wiki/Regular_language" title="Regular language">regular languages</a> or <a href="/wiki/Context-free_language" title="Context-free language">context-free languages</a>.  The notion of a <a href="/wiki/Formal_grammar" title="Formal grammar">formal grammar</a> may be closer to the intuitive concept of a "language," one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.\n</p>, <p>The following rules describe a formal language <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">L</span> over the alphabet \xce\xa3 = {\xe2\x80\x890,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x893,\xe2\x80\x894,\xe2\x80\x895,\xe2\x80\x896,\xe2\x80\x897,\xe2\x80\x898,\xe2\x80\x899,\xe2\x80\x89+,\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89}:\n</p>, <p>Under these rules, the string "23+4=555" is in <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">L</span>, but the string "=234=+" is not. This formal language expresses <a href="/wiki/Natural_number" title="Natural number">natural numbers</a>, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their <a href="/wiki/Syntax" title="Syntax">syntax</a>), not what they mean (<a href="/wiki/Semantics" title="Semantics">semantics</a>). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that "0" means the number zero,   "+" means addition, "23+4=555" is false, etc.\n</p>, <p>For finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">L</span> as just <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">L</span> = {"a",\xe2\x80\x89"b",\xe2\x80\x89"ab",\xe2\x80\x89"cba"}. The <a href="/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)" title="Degeneracy (mathematics)">degenerate</a> case of this construction is the <b>empty language</b>, which contains no words at all (<span class="nounderlines"><span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">L</span> = <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%E2%88%85" title="\xe2\x88\x85">\xe2\x88\x85</a></span>).\n</p>, <p>However, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as \xce\xa3 = {a, b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: "a", "abb", "ababba", "aaababbbbaab", \xe2\x80\xa6. Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing <i>L</i> = {"a",\xe2\x80\x89"b",\xe2\x80\x89"ab",\xe2\x80\x89"cba"}. Here are some examples of formal languages:\n</p>, <p>Formal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as\n</p>, <p>Typical questions asked about such formalisms include:\n</p>, <p>Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is "it cannot be done at all", or "it is extremely expensive" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computability_theory_(computer_science)" title="Computability theory (computer science)">computability theory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory" title="Computational complexity theory">complexity theory</a>.

This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.\n</p>, <p>Examples: suppose <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> are languages over some common alphabet.\n</p>, <p>Such <a href="/wiki/String_operations" title="String operations">string operations</a> are used to investigate <a href="/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)" title="Closure (mathematics)">closure properties</a> of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/Context-free_language" title="Context-free language">context-free languages</a> are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with <a href="/wiki/Regular_language" title="Regular language">regular languages</a>, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of <a href="/wiki/Cone_(formal_languages)" title="Cone (formal languages)">trios</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abstract_family_of_languages" title="Abstract family of languages">abstract families of languages</a> studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>A compiler usually has two distinct components.
