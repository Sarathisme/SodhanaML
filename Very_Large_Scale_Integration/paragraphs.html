[<p><b>Very-large-scale integration</b> (<b>VLSI</b>) is the process of creating an <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuit</a> (IC) by combining hundreds of thousands of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transistors" title="Transistors">transistors</a> or devices into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communication" title="Communication">communication</a> technologies were being developed. The <a href="/wiki/Microprocessor" title="Microprocessor">microprocessor</a> is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An <a href="/wiki/Electronic_circuit" title="Electronic circuit">electronic circuit</a> might consist of a <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit">CPU</a>, <a href="/wiki/Read-only_memory" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>, <a href="/wiki/Random-access_memory" title="Random-access memory">RAM</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Glue_logic" title="Glue logic">glue logic</a>. VLSI lets IC designers add all of these <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/System_on_chip" title="System on chip">into one chip</a>.\n</p>, <p>The <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_transistor" title="History of the transistor">history of the transistor</a> dates to the 1920s when several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid-state diodes and convert them into triodes.  Success came after World War II, when the use of silicon and germanium crystals as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and theory.  Scientists who had worked on radar returned to solid-state device development.  With the invention of transistors at Bell Labs in 1947, the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solid-state device.\n</p>, <p>With the small transistor at their hands, electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits.  However, as the complexity of circuits grew, problems arose.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-The_History_of_the_Integrated_Circuit_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-The_History_of_the_Integrated_Circuit-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>One problem was the size of the circuit. A complex circuit like a computer was dependent on speed.  If the components were large, the wires interconnecting them must be long.  The electric signals took time to go through the circuit, thus slowing the computer.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-The_History_of_the_Integrated_Circuit_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-The_History_of_the_Integrated_Circuit-1">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The <a href="/wiki/Invention_of_the_integrated_circuit" title="Invention of the integrated circuit">invention of the integrated circuit</a> by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Kilby" title="Jack Kilby">Jack Kilby</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Noyce" title="Robert Noyce">Robert Noyce</a> solved this problem by making all the components and the chip out of the same block (monolith) of semiconductor material.  The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated.  This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single-crystal silicon wafer, which led to small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s, and then large-scale integration (LSI) as well as VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, with tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions (10<sup>9</sup>)).\n</p>, <p>The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, and as a consequence, more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, perhaps as many as ten <a href="/wiki/Diode" title="Diode">diodes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transistor" title="Transistor">transistors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Resistor" title="Resistor">resistors</a> and <a href="/wiki/Capacitor" title="Capacitor">capacitors</a>, making it possible to fabricate one or more <a href="/wiki/Logic_gate" title="Logic gate">logic gates</a> on a single device. Now known retrospectively as <i><a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit#SSI,_MSI_and_LSI" title="Integrated circuit">small-scale integration</a></i> (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as <i><a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit#SSI,_MSI_and_LSI" title="Integrated circuit">medium-scale integration</a></i> (MSI). Further improvements led to <i><a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit#SSI,_MSI_and_LSI" title="Integrated circuit">large-scale integration</a></i> (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today\'s <a href="/wiki/Microprocessor" title="Microprocessor">microprocessors</a> have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors.\n</p>, <p>At one time, there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI. Terms like <i><a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit#ULSI,_WSI,_SOC_and_3D-IC" title="Integrated circuit">ultra-large-scale integration</a></i> (ULSI) were used. But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot. Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use.\n</p>, <p>In 2008, billion-transistor processors became commercially available. This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the then-current generation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/65_nanometer" title="65 nanometer">65Â nm</a> processes. Current designs, unlike the earliest devices, use extensive <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electronic_Design_Automation" title="Electronic Design Automation">design automation</a> and automated <a href="/wiki/Logic_synthesis" title="Logic synthesis">logic synthesis</a> to <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit_layout" title="Integrated circuit layout">lay out</a> the transistors, enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality. Certain high-performance logic blocks like the SRAM (<a href="/wiki/Static_random-access_memory" title="Static random-access memory">static random-access memory</a>) cell, are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency.\n</p>, <p>Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by <a href="/wiki/Carver_Mead" title="Carver Mead">Carver Mead</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lynn_Conway" title="Lynn Conway">Lynn Conway</a> for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Wiring_by_abutment&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Wiring by abutment (page does not exist)">wiring by abutment</a>. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells. In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Digital_Electronics_-_A_Modern_Approach_by_B_K_Jain_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Digital_Electronics_-_A_Modern_Approach_by_B_K_Jain-2">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s, but lost its popularity later because of the advent of <a href="/wiki/Place_and_route" title="Place and route">placement and routing</a> tools wasting a lot of area by <a href="/wiki/Routing_(electronic_design_automation)" title="Routing (electronic design automation)">routing</a>, which is tolerated because of the progress of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moore%27s_Law" title="Moore's Law">Moore\'s Law</a>.
