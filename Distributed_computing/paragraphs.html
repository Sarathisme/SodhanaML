However, it is not at all obvious what is meant by "solving a problem" in the case of a concurrent or distributed system: for example, what is the task of the algorithm designer, and what is the concurrent or distributed equivalent of a sequential general-purpose computer?<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Different fields might take the following approaches:\n</p>, <p>While the field of parallel algorithms has a different focus than the field of distributed algorithms, there is a lot of interaction between the two fields. For example, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cole%E2%80%93Vishkin_algorithm" title="Cole\xe2\x80\x93Vishkin algorithm">Cole\xe2\x80\x93Vishkin algorithm</a> for graph coloring<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> was originally presented as a parallel algorithm, but the same technique can also be used directly as a distributed algorithm.\n</p>, <p>Moreover, a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system (using shared memory) or in a distributed system (using message passing).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms (choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems (shared memory vs. message passing).\n</p>, <p>In parallel algorithms, yet another resource in addition to time and space is the number of computers. Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers running in parallel (see <a href="/wiki/Speedup" title="Speedup">speedup</a>). If a decision problem can be solved in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polylogarithmic_time" title="Polylogarithmic time">polylogarithmic time</a> by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class <a href="/wiki/NC_(complexity)" title="NC (complexity)">NC</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits\xe2\x80\x94PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>In the analysis of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. This model is commonly known as the LOCAL model. During each <i>communication round</i>, all nodes in parallel (1) receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2) perform arbitrary local computation, and (3) send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure is the number of synchronous communication rounds required to complete the task.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-43"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>This complexity measure is closely related to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diameter_(graph_theory)" title="Diameter (graph theory)">diameter</a> of the network. Let <i>D</i> be the diameter of the network. On the one hand, any computable problem can be solved trivially in a synchronous distributed system in approximately 2<i>D</i> communication rounds: simply gather all information in one location (<i>D</i> rounds), solve the problem, and inform each node about the solution (<i>D</i> rounds).\n</p>, <p>On the other hand, if the running time of the algorithm is much smaller than <i>D</i> communication rounds, then the nodes in the network must produce their output without having the possibility to obtain information about distant parts of the network. In other words, the nodes must make globally consistent decisions based on information that is available in their <i>local D-neighbourhood</i>. Many distributed algorithms are known with the running time much smaller than <i>D</i> rounds, and understanding which problems can be solved by such algorithms is one of the central research questions of the field<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-44"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>. Typically an algorithm which solves a problem in polylogarithmic time in the network size is considered efficient in this model.\n</p>, <p>Another commonly used measure is the total number of bits transmitted in the network (cf. <a href="/wiki/Communication_complexity" title="Communication complexity">communication complexity</a>)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SchneiderTrading11_45-0"><a href="#cite_note-SchneiderTrading11-45">[45]</a></sup>. The features of this concept are typically captured with the CONGEST(B) model, which similarly defined as the LOCAL model but where single messages can only contain B bits.\n</p>, <p>Traditional computational problems take the perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes the question for a while, and then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where we do not want the system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the <a href="/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem" title="Dining philosophers problem">dining philosophers problem</a> and other similar <a href="/wiki/Mutual_exclusion" title="Mutual exclusion">mutual exclusion</a> problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or <a href="/wiki/Deadlock" title="Deadlock">deadlocks</a> occur.\n</p>, <p>There are also fundamental challenges that are unique to distributed computing. The first example is challenges that are related to <i>fault-tolerance</i>.

Before the task is begun, all network nodes are either unaware which node will serve as the "coordinator" (or leader) of the task, or unable to communicate with the current coordinator. After a coordinator election algorithm has been run, however, each node throughout the network recognizes a particular, unique node as the task coordinator.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-HaloiApache15_52-0"><a href="#cite_note-HaloiApache15-52">[52]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the "coordinator" state.
