Just as a relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index variables, GIS can relate otherwise unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. The key is the location and/or extent in space-time.\n</p>, <p>Any variable that can be located spatially, and increasingly also temporally, can be referenced using a GIS. Locations or extents in Earth space\xe2\x80\x93time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Coordinate" title="Coordinate">coordinates</a> representing, <a href="/wiki/Longitude" title="Longitude">longitude</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elevation_(geography)" title="Elevation (geography)">elevation</a>, respectively.

In order to digitize a map, the map has to be checked within theoretical dimensions, then scanned into a raster format, and resulting raster data has to be given a theoretical dimension by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rubber" title="Rubber">rubber</a> sheeting/warping technology process.\n</p>, <p>A quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus. The electronic and other equipment used to make measurements for GIS is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis. All geographical data are inherently inaccurate, and these inaccuracies will propagate through GIS operations in ways that are difficult to predict.\n</p>, <p>GIS data represents real objects (such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, etc.) with digital data determining the mix. Real objects can be divided into two abstractions: discrete objects (e.g., a house) and continuous fields (such as rainfall amount, or elevations). Traditionally, there are two broad methods used to store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Raster_images" title="Raster images">raster images</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics">vector</a>. Points, lines, and polygons are the stuff of mapped location attribute references. A new hybrid method of storing data is that of identifying point clouds, which combine three-dimensional points with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RGB" title="RGB">RGB</a> information at each point, returning a "<a href="/wiki/Anaglyph_3D" title="Anaglyph 3D">3D color image</a>". GIS thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually descriptive of what they set out to show or determine.\n</p>, <p>For a list of popular GIS file formats, such as <a href="/wiki/Shapefile" title="Shapefile">shapefiles</a>, see <a href="/wiki/GIS_file_formats#Popular_GIS_file_formats" title="GIS file formats">GIS file formats \xc2\xa7 Popular GIS file formats</a>.\n</p>, <p>Data capture\xe2\x80\x94entering information into the system\xe2\x80\x94consumes much of the time of GIS practitioners. There are a variety of methods used to enter data into a GIS where it is stored in a digital format.\n</p>, <p>Existing data printed on paper or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PET_film_(biaxially_oriented)" title="PET film (biaxially oriented)">PET film</a> maps can be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Digitizer" title="Digitizer">digitized</a> or scanned to produce digital data. A digitizer produces <a href="/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics">vector</a> data as an operator traces points, lines, and polygon boundaries from a map. <a href="/wiki/Image_scanner" title="Image scanner">Scanning</a> a map results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Surveying" title="Surveying">Survey</a> data can be directly entered into a GIS from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a technique called <a href="/wiki/Analytic_geometry" title="Analytic geometry">coordinate geometry (COGO)</a>. Positions from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like <a href="/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" title="Global Positioning System">Global Positioning System</a> can also be collected and then imported into a GIS. A current trend in data collection gives users the ability to utilize <a href="/wiki/Rugged_computer" title="Rugged computer">field computers</a> with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections or disconnected editing sessions.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> This has been enhanced by the availability of low-cost mapping-grade GPS units with decimeter accuracy in real time. This eliminates the need to post process, import, and update the data in the office after fieldwork has been collected. This includes the ability to incorporate positions collected using a <a href="/wiki/Laser_rangefinder" title="Laser rangefinder">laser rangefinder</a>. New technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the field, making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Remote_sensing" title="Remote sensing">Remotely sensed</a> data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a platform. Sensors include cameras, digital scanners and <a href="/wiki/Lidar" title="Lidar">lidar</a>, while platforms usually consist of aircraft and <a href="/wiki/Satellite" title="Satellite">satellites</a>. In England in the mid 1990s, hybrid kite/balloons called <a href="/wiki/Allsopp_Helikite" title="Allsopp Helikite">helikites</a> first pioneered the use of compact airborne digital cameras as airborne geo-information systems. Aircraft measurement software, accurate to 0.4 mm was used to link the photographs and measure the ground. Helikites are inexpensive and gather more accurate data than aircraft. Helikites can be used over roads, railways and towns where <a href="/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle" title="Unmanned aerial vehicle">unmanned aerial vehicles</a> (UAVs) are banned.\n</p>, <p>Recently aerial data collection is becoming possible with <a href="/wiki/Miniature_UAV" title="Miniature UAV">miniature UAVs</a>. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Aeryon_Scout" title="Aeryon Scout">Aeryon Scout</a> was used to map a 50-acre area with a <a href="/wiki/Ground_sample_distance" title="Ground sample distance">ground sample distance</a> of 1 inch (2.54 cm) in only 12 minutes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The majority of digital data currently comes from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Photo_interpretation" title="Photo interpretation">photo interpretation</a> of aerial photographs. Soft-copy workstations are used to digitize features directly from <a href="/wiki/Stereoscopy" title="Stereoscopy">stereo pairs</a> of digital photographs. These systems allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions, with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair using principles of <a href="/wiki/Photogrammetry" title="Photogrammetry">photogrammetry</a>. Analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft-copy system, for high-quality digital cameras this step is skipped.\n</p>, <p>Satellite <a href="/wiki/Remote_sensing" title="Remote sensing">remote sensing</a> provides another important source of spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> or radio waves that were sent out from an active sensor such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.\n</p>, <p>When data is captured, the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or absolute accuracy, since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of data capture.\n</p>, <p>After entering data into a GIS, the data usually requires editing, to remove errors, or further processing. For vector data it must be made "topologically correct" before it can be used for some advanced analysis. For example, in a road network, lines must connect with nodes at an intersection. Errors such as undershoots and overshoots must also be removed. For scanned maps, blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the resulting <a href="/wiki/Raster_graphics" title="Raster graphics">raster</a>. For example, a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected.\n</p>, <p>Data restructuring can be performed by a GIS to convert data into different formats. For example, a GIS may be used to convert a satellite image map to a vector structure by generating lines around all cells with the same classification, while determining the cell spatial relationships, such as adjacency or inclusion.\n</p>, <p>More advanced data processing can occur with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Image_processing" title="Image processing">image processing</a>, a technique developed in the late 1960s by <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> and the private sector to provide contrast enhancement, false color rendering and a variety of other techniques including use of two dimensional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fourier_transforms" title="Fourier transforms">Fourier transforms</a>. Since digital data is collected and stored in various ways, the two data sources may not be entirely compatible. So a GIS must be able to convert <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geographic_data" title="Geographic data">geographic data</a> from one structure to another. In so doing, the implicit assumptions behind different ontologies and classifications require analysis.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Object ontologies have gained increasing prominence as a consequence of <a href="/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> and sustained work by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barry_Smith_(academic_and_ontologist)" title="Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)">Barry Smith</a> and co-workers.\n</p>, <p>The earth can be represented by various models, each of which may provide a different set of coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, elevation) for any given point on the Earth\'s surface. The simplest model is to assume the earth is a perfect sphere. As more measurements of the earth have accumulated, the models of the earth have become more sophisticated and more accurate. In fact, there are models called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Datum_(geodesy)" title="Datum (geodesy)">datums</a> that apply to different areas of the earth to provide increased accuracy, like <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NAD83" title="NAD83">NAD83</a> for U.S. measurements, and the <a href="/wiki/World_Geodetic_System" title="World Geodetic System">World Geodetic System</a> for worldwide measurements.\n</p>, <p>GIS spatial analysis is a rapidly changing field, and GIS packages are increasingly including analytical tools as standard built-in facilities, as optional toolsets, as add-ins or \'analysts\'. In many instances these are provided by the original software suppliers (commercial vendors or collaborative non commercial development teams), while in other cases facilities have been developed and are provided by third parties. Furthermore, many products offer software development kits (SDKs), programming languages and language support, scripting facilities and/or special interfaces for developing one\'s own analytical tools or variants. The increased availability has created a new dimension to <a href="/wiki/Business_intelligence" title="Business intelligence">business intelligence</a> termed "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spatial_intelligence_(business_method)" title="Spatial intelligence (business method)">spatial intelligence</a>" which, when openly delivered via intranet, democratizes access to geographic and social network data. <a href="/wiki/Geospatial_intelligence" title="Geospatial intelligence">Geospatial intelligence</a>, based on GIS spatial analysis, has also become a key element for security.

A GIS, however, can be used to depict two- and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth\'s surface, subsurface, and atmosphere from information points. For example, a GIS can quickly generate a map with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isopleth" title="Isopleth">isopleth</a> or <a href="/wiki/Contour_line" title="Contour line">contour lines</a> that indicate differing amounts of rainfall. Such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map. Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. A two-dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area. This GIS derived map can then provide additional information - such as the viability of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Water_power" title="Water power">water power</a> potential as a <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> source. Similarly, GIS can be used to compare other <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> resources to find the best geographic potential for a region.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Additionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, or <a href="/wiki/Digital_elevation_model" title="Digital elevation model">digital elevation model</a>, isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shaded_relief" title="Shaded relief">shaded relief</a>, and other elevation products. Watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach, by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest. Similarly, an expected <a href="/wiki/Thalweg" title="Thalweg">thalweg</a> of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the GIS.\n</p>, <p>A GIS can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data. These <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Topological" title="Topological">topological</a> relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed. Topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency (what adjoins what), containment (what encloses what), and proximity (how close something is to something else).\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Geometric_networks" title="Geometric networks">Geometric networks</a> are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features, and to perform special spatial analysis on them. A geometric network is composed of edges, which are connected at junction points, similar to <a href="/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)" title="Graph (discrete mathematics)">graphs</a> in mathematics and computer science. Just like graphs, networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges, which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and <a href="/wiki/Public_utility" title="Public utility">public utility</a> networks, such as electric, gas, and water networks. Network modeling is also commonly employed in <a href="/wiki/Transportation_planning" title="Transportation planning">transportation planning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrology" title="Hydrology">hydrology</a> modeling, and <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> modeling.\n</p>, <p>GIS hydrological models can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack, with the analysis of variables such as slope, aspect and watershed or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catchment_area_(human_geography)" title="Catchment area (human geography)">catchment area</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Heywood_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-Heywood-27">[27]</a></sup> Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Heywood_27-1"><a href="#cite_note-Heywood-27">[27]</a></sup> As basic terrain analysis of a <a href="/wiki/Digital_elevation_model" title="Digital elevation model">digital elevation model (DEM)</a> involves calculation of slope and aspect, DEMs are very useful for hydrological analysis. Slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff, and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams, rivers and lakes. Areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment. Once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created, queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Heywood_27-2"><a href="#cite_note-Heywood-27">[27]</a></sup> More detail can be added to the model, such as terrain roughness, vegetation types and soil types, which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and hence influencing surface flow.

A <a href="/wiki/Symmetric_difference" title="Symmetric difference">symmetric difference</a> overlay defines an output area that includes the total area of both inputs except for the overlapping area.\n</p>, <p>Data extraction is a GIS process similar to vector overlay, though it can be used in either vector or raster data analysis. Rather than combining the properties and features of both datasets, data extraction involves using a "clip" or "mask" to extract the features of one data set that fall within the spatial extent of another dataset.\n</p>, <p>In raster data analysis, the overlay of datasets is accomplished through a process known as "local operation on multiple rasters" or "<a href="/wiki/Map_algebra" title="Map algebra">map algebra</a>", through a function that combines the values of each raster\'s <a href="/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrix</a>. This function may weigh some inputs more than others through use of an "index model" that reflects the influence of various factors upon a geographic phenomenon.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Geostatistics" title="Geostatistics">Geostatistics</a> is a branch of statistics that deals with field data, spatial data with a continuous index. It provides methods to model spatial correlation, and predict values at arbitrary locations (interpolation).\n</p>, <p>When phenomena are measured, the observation methods dictate the accuracy of any subsequent analysis. Due to the nature of the data (e.g. traffic patterns in an urban environment; weather patterns over the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>), a constant or dynamic degree of precision is always lost in the measurement. This loss of precision is determined from the scale and distribution of the data collection.\n</p>, <p>To determine the statistical relevance of the analysis, an average is determined so that points (gradients) outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior. This is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods, and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles, points, and locations that are not directly measurable.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Interpolation" title="Interpolation">Interpolation</a> is the process by which a surface is created, usually a raster dataset, through the input of data collected at a number of sample points. There are several forms of interpolation, each which treats the data differently, depending on the properties of the data set. In comparing interpolation methods, the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change (exact or approximate). Next is whether the method is subjective, a human interpretation, or objective. Then there is the nature of transitions between points: are they abrupt or gradual. Finally, there is whether a method is global (it uses the entire data set to form the model), or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain.\n</p>, <p>Interpolation is a justified measurement because of a spatial autocorrelation principle that recognizes that data collected at any position will have a great similarity to, or influence of those locations within its immediate vicinity.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Digital_elevation_model" title="Digital elevation model">Digital elevation models</a>, <a href="/wiki/Triangulated_irregular_network" title="Triangulated irregular network">triangulated irregular networks</a>, edge-finding algorithms, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thiessen_polygons" title="Thiessen polygons">Thiessen polygons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fourier_analysis" title="Fourier analysis">Fourier analysis</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Weighted_moving_average" title="Weighted moving average">(weighted) moving averages</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting" title="Inverse distance weighting">inverse distance weighting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kriging" title="Kriging">kriging</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)" title="Spline (mathematics)">spline</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trend_estimation" title="Trend estimation">trend surface analysis</a> are all mathematical methods to produce interpolative data.\n</p>, <p>Geocoding is interpolating spatial locations (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data such as <a href="/wiki/ZIP_Code" title="ZIP Code">ZIP Codes</a>, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to <a href="/wiki/Geocoding" title="Geocoding">geocode</a> individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided in the form of a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 1 and ends with address 1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.\n</p>, <p>Reverse geocoding is the process of returning an estimated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Street_address" title="Street address">street address</a> number as it relates to a given coordinate. For example, a user can click on a road centerline theme (thus providing a coordinate) and have information returned that reflects the estimated house number. This house number is interpolated from a range assigned to that road segment. If the user clicks at the <a href="/wiki/Midpoint" title="Midpoint">midpoint</a> of a segment that starts with address 1 and ends with 100, the returned value will be somewhere near 50. Note that reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range.\n</p>, <p>Coupled with GIS, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multi-criteria_decision_analysis" title="Multi-criteria decision analysis">multi-criteria decision analysis</a> methods support decision-makers in analysing a set of alternative spatial solutions, such as the most likely ecological habitat for restoration, against multiple criteria, such as vegetation cover or roads.

The vast majority of modern cartography is done with the help of computers, usually using GIS but production of quality cartography is also achieved by importing layers into a design program to refine it. Most GIS software gives the user substantial control over the appearance of the data.\n</p>, <p>Cartographic work serves two major functions:\n</p>, <p>First, it produces graphics on the screen or on paper that convey the results of analysis to the people who make decisions about resources. Wall maps and other graphics can be generated, allowing the viewer to visualize and thereby understand the results of analyses or simulations of potential events. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_Map_Server" title="Web Map Server">Web Map Servers</a> facilitate distribution of generated maps through web browsers using various implementations of web-based application programming interfaces (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AJAX" title="AJAX">AJAX</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Java_programming" title="Java programming">Java</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adobe_Flash" title="Adobe Flash">Flash</a>, etc.).\n</p>, <p>Second, other database information can be generated for further analysis or use. An example would be a list of all addresses within one mile (1.6 km) of a toxic spill.\n</p>, <p>Traditional maps are abstractions of the real world, a sampling of important elements portrayed on a sheet of paper with symbols to represent physical objects. People who use maps must interpret these symbols. <a href="/wiki/Topographic_map" title="Topographic map">Topographic maps</a> show the shape of land surface with <a href="/wiki/Contour_line" title="Contour line">contour lines</a> or with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cartographic_relief_depiction" title="Cartographic relief depiction">shaded relief</a>.\n</p>, <p>Today, graphic display techniques such as <a href="/wiki/Shading" title="Shading">shading</a> based on <a href="/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a> in a GIS can make relationships among map elements visible, heightening one\'s ability to extract and analyze information. For example, two types of data were combined in a GIS to produce a perspective view of a portion of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Mateo_County" title="San Mateo County">San Mateo County</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>.\n</p>, <p>A GIS was used to register and combine the two images to <a href="/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)" title="Rendering (computer graphics)">render</a> the three-dimensional <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Perspective_view" title="Perspective view">perspective view</a> looking down the <a href="/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault" title="San Andreas Fault">San Andreas Fault</a>, using the Thematic Mapper image pixels, but shaded using the elevation of the <a href="/wiki/Landform" title="Landform">landforms</a>.

These tools can come in the form of add-ins to existing wider-purpose software such as <a href="/wiki/Spreadsheet" title="Spreadsheet">spreadsheets</a>.\n</p>, <p>GIS or spatial <a href="/wiki/Data_mining" title="Data mining">data mining</a> is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-based decision making.

GIS technology gives researchers the ability to examine the variations in Earth processes over days, months, and years. As an example, the changes in vegetation vigor through a growing season can be animated to determine when drought was most extensive in a particular region. The resulting graphic represents a rough measure of plant health. Working with two variables over time would then allow researchers to detect regional differences in the lag between a decline in rainfall and its effect on vegetation.\n</p>, <p>GIS technology and the availability of digital data on regional and global scales enable such analyses. The satellite sensor output used to generate a vegetation graphic is produced for example by the <a href="/wiki/Advanced_very-high-resolution_radiometer" title="Advanced very-high-resolution radiometer">advanced very-high-resolution radiometer</a> (AVHRR). This sensor system detects the amounts of energy reflected from the Earth\'s surface across various bands of the spectrum for surface areas of about 1 square kilometer. The satellite sensor produces images of a particular location on the Earth twice a day. AVHRR and more recently the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moderate-resolution_imaging_spectroradiometer" title="Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer">moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer</a> (MODIS) are only two of many sensor systems used for Earth surface analysis.\n</p>, <p>In addition to the integration of time in environmental studies, GIS is also being explored for its ability to track and model the progress of humans throughout their daily routines. A concrete example of progress in this area is the recent release of time-specific population data by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Census" title="U.S. Census">U.S. Census</a>.
