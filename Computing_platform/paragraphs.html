[<p>A <b>computing platform</b> or <b>digital platform</b><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> is the environment in which a piece of <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> is executed. It may be the <a href="/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> (OS), even a <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browser</a> and associated <a href="/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="Application programming interface">application programming interfaces</a>, or other underlying software, as long as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Program_code" title="Program code">program code</a> is executed with it. Computing platforms have different <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)" title="Abstraction (software engineering)">abstraction</a> levels, including a <a href="/wiki/Computer_architecture" title="Computer architecture">computer architecture</a>, an OS, or <a href="/wiki/Runtime_library" title="Runtime library">runtime libraries</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run.\n</p>, <p>A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the <a href="/wiki/Software_development_process" title="Software development process">software development process</a>, in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions; and as an assistance to the development process, in that they provide low-level functionality ready-made.  For example, an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/File_(computing)" title="File (computing)">files</a> or accessing the <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a>.\n</p>, <p>Platforms may also include:\n</p>, <p>Some architectures have multiple layers, with each layer acting as a platform to the one above it. In general, a component only has to be adapted to the layer immediately beneath it. For instance, a Java program has to be written to use the Java virtual machine (JVM) and associated libraries as a platform but does not have to be adapted to run for the Windows, Linux or Macintosh OS platforms. However, the JVM, the layer beneath the application, does have to be built separately for each OS.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Ordered roughly, from more common types to less common types:\n</p>]
