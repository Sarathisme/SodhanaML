The terms "<a href="/wiki/Interpreted_language" title="Interpreted language">interpreted language</a>" or "<a href="/wiki/Compiled_language" title="Compiled language">compiled language</a>" signify that the canonical implementation of that language is an interpreter or a compiler, respectively. A <a href="/wiki/High-level_programming_language" title="High-level programming language">high level language</a> is ideally an <a href="/wiki/Abstraction" title="Abstraction">abstraction</a> independent of particular implementations.\n</p>, <p>Interpreters were used as early as 1952 to ease programming within the limitations of computers at the time (e.g. a shortage of program storage space, or no native support for floating point numbers). Interpreters were also used to translate between low-level machine languages, allowing code to be written for machines that were still under construction and tested on computers that already existed.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The first interpreted high-level language was <a href="/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language)">Lisp</a>. Lisp was first implemented in 1958 by <a href="/wiki/Steve_Russell_(computer_scientist)" title="Steve Russell (computer scientist)">Steve Russell</a> on an <a href="/wiki/IBM_704" title="IBM 704">IBM 704</a> computer. Russell had read <a href="/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" title="John McCarthy (computer scientist)">John McCarthy</a>\'s paper, and realized (to McCarthy\'s surprise) that the Lisp <i>eval</i> function could be implemented in machine code.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The result was a working Lisp interpreter which could be used to run Lisp programs, or more properly, "evaluate Lisp expressions".\n</p>, <p>Programs written in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_level_language" title="High level language">high level language</a> are either directly executed by some kind of interpreter or converted into <a href="/wiki/Machine_code" title="Machine code">machine code</a> by a compiler (and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Assembler_(computing)" title="Assembler (computing)">assembler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a>) for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPU" title="CPU">CPU</a> to execute.\n</p>, <p>While compilers (and assemblers) generally produce machine code directly executable by computer hardware, they can often (optionally) produce an intermediate form called <a href="/wiki/Object_code" title="Object code">object code</a>. This is basically the same machine specific code but augmented with a symbol table with names and tags to make executable blocks (or modules) identifiable and relocatable. Compiled programs will typically use building blocks (functions) kept in a library of such object code modules. A <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a> is used to combine (pre-made) library files with the object file(s) of the application to form a single executable file. The object files that are used to generate an executable file are thus often produced at different times, and sometimes even by different languages (capable of generating the same object format).\n</p>, <p>A simple interpreter written in a low level language (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly</a>) may have similar machine code blocks implementing functions of the high level language stored, and executed when a function\'s entry in a look up table points to that code. However, an interpreter written in a high level language typically uses another approach, such as generating and then walking a <a href="/wiki/Parse_tree" title="Parse tree">parse tree</a>, or by generating and executing intermediate software-defined instructions, or both.\n</p>, <p>Thus, both compilers and interpreters generally turn source code (text files) into tokens, both may (or may not) generate a parse tree, and both may generate immediate instructions (for a <a href="/wiki/Stack_machine" title="Stack machine">stack machine</a>, <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Quadruple_code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Quadruple code (page does not exist)">quadruple code</a>, or by other means). The basic difference is that a compiler system, including a (built in or separate) linker, generates a stand-alone <i>machine code</i> program, while an interpreter system instead <i>performs</i> the actions described by the high level program.\n</p>, <p>A compiler can thus make almost all the conversions from source code semantics to the machine level once and for all (i.e. until the program has to be changed) while an interpreter has to do <i>some</i> of this conversion work every time a statement or function is executed. However, in an efficient interpreter, much of the translation work (including analysis of types, and similar) is factored out and done only the first time a program, module, function, or even statement, is run, thus quite akin to how a compiler works. However, a compiled program still runs much faster, under most circumstances, in part because compilers are designed to optimize code, and may be given ample time for this. This is especially true for simpler high level languages without (many) dynamic data structures, checks, or type-checks.\n</p>, <p>In traditional compilation, the executable output of the linkers (.exe files or .dll files or a library, see picture) is typically relocatable when run under a general operating system, much like the object code modules are but with the difference that this relocation is done dynamically at run time, i.e. when the program is loaded for execution. On the other hand, compiled and linked programs for small <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Embedded_systems" title="Embedded systems">embedded systems</a> are typically statically allocated, often hard coded in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NOR_flash" title="NOR flash">NOR flash</a> memory, as there is often no secondary storage and no operating system in this sense.\n</p>, <p>Historically, most interpreter-systems have had a self-contained editor built in. This is becoming more common also for compilers (then often called an <a href="/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" title="Integrated development environment">IDE</a>), although some programmers prefer to use an editor of their choice and run the compiler, linker and other tools manually. Historically, compilers predate interpreters because hardware at that time could not support both the interpreter and interpreted code and the typical batch environment of the time limited the advantages of interpretation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>During the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Software_development_cycle" title="Software development cycle">software development cycle</a>, programmers make frequent changes to source code. When using a compiler, each time a change is made to the source code, they must wait for the compiler to translate the altered source files and <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">link</a> all of the binary code files together before the program can be executed. The larger the program, the longer the wait. By contrast, a programmer using an interpreter does a lot less waiting, as the interpreter usually just needs to translate the code being worked on to an intermediate representation (or not translate it at all), thus requiring much less time before the changes can be tested. Effects are evident upon saving the source code and reloading the program. Compiled code is generally less readily debugged as editing, compiling, and linking are sequential processes that have to be conducted in the proper sequence with a proper set of commands. For this reason, many compilers also have an executive aid, known as a <a href="/wiki/Make_(software)" title="Make (software)">Make</a> file and program. The Make file lists compiler and linker command lines and program source code files, but might take a simple command line menu input (e.g. "Make 3") which selects the third group (set) of instructions then issues the commands to the compiler, and linker feeding the specified source code files.\n</p>, <p>A <a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a> converts source code into binary instruction for a specific processor\'s architecture, thus making it less portable. This conversion is made just once, on the developer\'s environment, and after that the same binary can be distributed to the user\'s machines where it can be executed without further translation. A <a href="/wiki/Cross_compiler" title="Cross compiler">cross compiler</a> can generate binary code for the user machine even if it has a different processor than the machine where the code is compiled.\n</p>, <p>An interpreted program can be distributed as source code. It needs to be translated in each final machine, which takes more time but makes the program distribution independent of the machine\'s architecture. However, the portability of interpreted source code is dependent on the target machine actually having a suitable interpreter. If the interpreter needs to be supplied along with the source, the overall installation process is more complex than delivery of a monolithic executable since the interpreter itself is part of what need be installed.\n</p>, <p>The fact that interpreted code can easily be read and copied by humans can be of concern from the point of view of <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a>. However, various systems of <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a> and <a href="/wiki/Obfuscation" title="Obfuscation">obfuscation</a> exist. Delivery of intermediate code, such as bytecode, has a similar effect to obfuscation, but bytecode could be decoded with a <a href="/wiki/Decompiler" title="Decompiler">decompiler</a> or <a href="/wiki/Disassembler" title="Disassembler">disassembler</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The difference in speeds could be tiny or great; often an order of magnitude and sometimes more. It generally takes longer to run a program under an interpreter than to run the compiled code but it can take less time to interpret it than the total time required to compile and run it. This is especially important when prototyping and testing code when an edit-interpret-debug cycle can often be much shorter than an edit-compile-run-debug cycle.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2013)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>\n</p>, <p>Interpreting code is slower than running the compiled code because the interpreter must analyze each <a href="/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)" title="Statement (computer science)">statement</a> in the program each time it is executed and then perform the desired action, whereas the compiled code just performs the action within a fixed context determined by the compilation. This <a href="/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)" title="Run time (program lifecycle phase)">run-time</a> analysis is known as "interpretive overhead". Access to variables is also slower in an interpreter because the mapping of identifiers to storage locations must be done repeatedly at run-time rather than at <a href="/wiki/Compile_time" title="Compile time">compile time</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Some systems (such as some <a href="/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language)">Lisps</a>) allow interpreted and compiled code to call each other and to share variables. This means that once a routine has been tested and debugged under the interpreter it can be compiled and thus benefit from faster execution while other routines are being developed.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2013)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Many interpreters do not execute the source code as it stands but convert it into some more compact internal form. Many <a href="/wiki/BASIC" title="BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreters replace <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keyword_(computer_programming)" title="Keyword (computer programming)">keywords</a> with single <a href="/wiki/Byte" title="Byte">byte</a> <a href="/wiki/Threaded_code#Token_threading" title="Threaded code">tokens</a> which can be used to find the instruction in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jump_table" title="Jump table">jump table</a>. A few interpreters, such as the <a href="/wiki/PBASIC" title="PBASIC">PBASIC</a> interpreter, achieve even higher levels of program compaction by using a bit-oriented rather than a byte-oriented program memory structure, where commands tokens occupy perhaps 5 bits, nominally "16-bit" constants are stored in a <a href="/wiki/Variable-length_code" title="Variable-length code">variable-length code</a> requiring 3, 6, 10, or 18 bits, and address operands include a "bit offset". Many BASIC interpreters can store and read back their own tokenized internal representation.\n</p>, <p>An interpreter might well use the same <a href="/wiki/Lexical_analysis" title="Lexical analysis">lexical analyzer</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parser" title="Parser">parser</a> as the compiler and then interpret the resulting <a href="/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" title="Abstract syntax tree">abstract syntax tree</a>.\nExample data type definitions for the latter, and a toy interpreter for syntax trees obtained from <a href="/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a> expressions are shown in the box.\n</p>, <p>Interpretation cannot be used as the sole method of execution: even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted and so on, a directly executed program is needed somewhere at the bottom of the stack because the code being interpreted is not, by definition, the same as the machine code that the CPU can execute.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>There is a spectrum of possibilities between interpreting and compiling, depending on the amount of analysis performed before the program is executed. For example, <a href="/wiki/Emacs_Lisp" title="Emacs Lisp">Emacs Lisp</a> is compiled to <a href="/wiki/Bytecode" title="Bytecode">bytecode</a>, which is a highly compressed and optimized representation of the Lisp source, but is not machine code (and therefore not tied to any particular hardware). This "compiled" code is then interpreted by a bytecode interpreter (itself written in <a href="/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a>). The compiled code in this case is machine code for a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machine</a>, which is implemented not in hardware, but in the bytecode interpreter. Such compiling interpreters are sometimes also called <i>compreters</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-K\xc3\xbchnel_1987_Kleincomputer_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-K\xc3\xbchnel_1987_Kleincomputer-8">[8]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Heyne_1984_Compreter_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Heyne_1984_Compreter-9">[9]</a></sup> In a bytecode interpreter each instruction starts with a byte, and therefore bytecode interpreters have up to 256 instructions, although not all may be used. Some bytecodes may take multiple bytes, and may be arbitrarily complicated.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Control_table" title="Control table">Control tables</a> - that do not necessarily ever need to pass through a compiling phase - dictate appropriate algorithmic <a href="/wiki/Control_flow" title="Control flow">control flow</a> via customized interpreters in similar fashion to bytecode interpreters.\n</p>, <p>Threaded code interpreters are similar to bytecode interpreters but instead of bytes they use pointers. Each "instruction" is a word that points to a function or an instruction sequence, possibly followed by a parameter. The threaded code interpreter either loops fetching instructions and calling the functions they point to, or fetches the first instruction and jumps to it, and every instruction sequence ends with a fetch and jump to the next instruction. Unlike bytecode there is no effective limit on the number of different instructions other than available memory and address space. The classic example of threaded code is the <a href="/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" title="Forth (programming language)">Forth</a> code used in <a href="/wiki/Open_Firmware" title="Open Firmware">Open Firmware</a> systems: the source language is compiled into "F code" (a bytecode), which is then interpreted by a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machine</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2013)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>\n</p>, <p>In the spectrum between interpreting and compiling, another approach is to transform the source code into an optimized abstract syntax tree (AST), then execute the program following this tree structure, or use it to generate native code <a href="/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation" title="Just-in-time compilation">just-in-time</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> In this approach, each sentence needs to be parsed just once. As an advantage over bytecode, the AST keeps the global program structure and relations between statements (which is lost in a bytecode representation), and when compressed provides a more compact representation.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Thus, using AST has been proposed as a better intermediate format for just-in-time compilers than bytecode. Also, it allows the system to perform better analysis during runtime.\n</p>, <p>However, for interpreters, an AST causes more overhead than a bytecode interpreter, because of nodes related to syntax performing no useful work, of a less sequential representation (requiring traversal of more pointers) and of overhead visiting the tree.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Further blurring the distinction between interpreters, bytecode interpreters and compilation is just-in-time compilation (JIT), a technique in which the intermediate representation is compiled to native <a href="/wiki/Machine_code" title="Machine code">machine code</a> at runtime. This confers the efficiency of running native code, at the cost of startup time and increased memory use when the bytecode or AST is first compiled. <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_optimization" title="Adaptive optimization">Adaptive optimization</a> is a complementary technique in which the interpreter profiles the running program and compiles its most frequently executed parts into native code.
