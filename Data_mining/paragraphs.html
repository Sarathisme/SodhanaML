The journal <i>Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</i> is the primary research journal of the field.\n</p>, <p>The manual extraction of patterns from <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a> has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include <a href="/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" title="Bayes' theorem">Bayes\' theorem</a> (1700s) and <a href="/wiki/Regression_analysis" title="Regression analysis">regression analysis</a> (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As <a href="/wiki/Data_set" title="Data set">data sets</a> have grown in size and complexity, direct "hands-on" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neural_networks" title="Neural networks">neural networks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cluster_analysis" title="Cluster analysis">cluster analysis</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Genetic_algorithms" title="Genetic algorithms">genetic algorithms</a> (1950s), <a href="/wiki/Decision_tree_learning" title="Decision tree learning">decision trees</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Decision_rules" title="Decision rules">decision rules</a> (1960s), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Support_vector_machines" title="Support vector machines">support vector machines</a> (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Kantardzic_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kantardzic-15">[15]</a></sup> in large data sets. It bridges the gap from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Applied_statistics" title="Applied statistics">applied statistics</a> and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Database_management" title="Database management">database management</a> by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets.\n</p>, <p>The <i>knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process</i> is commonly defined with the stages:\n</p>, <p>It exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining" title="Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining">Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining</a> (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases:\n</p>, <p>or a simplified process such as (1) Pre-processing, (2) Data Mining, and (3) Results Validation.\n</p>, <p>Polls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> The only other data mining standard named in these polls was <a href="/wiki/SEMMA" title="SEMMA">SEMMA</a>.

As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a <a href="/wiki/Data_mart" title="Data mart">data mart</a> or <a href="/wiki/Data_warehouse" title="Data warehouse">data warehouse</a>. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the <a href="/wiki/Multivariate_statistics" title="Multivariate statistics">multivariate</a> data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Statistical_noise" title="Statistical noise">noise</a> and those with <a href="/wiki/Missing_data" title="Missing data">missing data</a>.\n</p>, <p>Data mining involves six common classes of tasks:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Fayyad_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-Fayyad-5">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and can then produce results which appear to be significant; but which do not actually predict future behaviour and cannot be <a href="/wiki/Reproducibility" title="Reproducibility">reproduced</a> on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper <a href="/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing" title="Statistical hypothesis testing">statistical hypothesis testing</a>. A simple version of this problem in <a href="/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine learning">machine learning</a> is known as <a href="/wiki/Overfitting" title="Overfitting">overfitting</a>, but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split - when applicable at all - may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hawkins_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-hawkins-20">[20]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called <a href="/wiki/Overfitting" title="Overfitting">overfitting</a>. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Test_set" title="Test set">test set</a> of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish "spam" from "legitimate" emails would be trained on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Training_set" title="Training set">training set</a> of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had <i>not</i> been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as <a href="/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic" title="Receiver operating characteristic">ROC curves</a>.\n</p>, <p>If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.\n</p>, <p>The premier professional body in the field is the <a href="/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery" title="Association for Computing Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a>\'s (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (<a href="/wiki/SIGKDD" title="SIGKDD">SIGKDD</a>).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Since 1989, this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> and since 1999 it has published a biannual <a href="/wiki/Academic_journal" title="Academic journal">academic journal</a> titled "SIGKDD Explorations".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Computer science conferences on data mining include:\n</p>, <p>Data mining topics are also present on many <a href="/wiki/List_of_computer_science_conferences#Data_Management" title="List of computer science conferences">data management/database conferences</a> such as the ICDE Conference, <a href="/wiki/SIGMOD" title="SIGMOD">SIGMOD Conference</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/International_Conference_on_Very_Large_Data_Bases" title="International Conference on Very Large Data Bases">International Conference on Very Large Data Bases</a>\n</p>, <p>There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example the 1999 European <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining" title="Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining">Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining</a> (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 <a href="/wiki/Java_Data_Mining" title="Java Data Mining">Java Data Mining</a> standard (JDM 1.0).
