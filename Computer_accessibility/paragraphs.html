[<p>In <a href="/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction" title="Human\xe2\x80\x93computer interaction">human\xe2\x80\x93computer interaction</a>, <b>computer accessibility</b> (also known as <b>accessible computing</b>) refers to the <a href="/wiki/Accessibility" title="Accessibility">accessibility</a> of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Computer_system" title="Computer system">computer system</a> to all people, regardless of <a href="/wiki/Disability" title="Disability">disability</a> type or severity of impairment. The term <i>accessibility</i> is most often used in reference to specialized hardware or <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a>, or a combination of both, designed to enable use of a computer by a person with a disability or impairment. Specific technologies may be referred to as <a href="/wiki/Assistive_technology" title="Assistive technology">assistive technology</a>.\n</p>, <p>There are many disabilities or impairments that can be a barrier to effective computer use. These impairments, which can be acquired from <a href="/wiki/Disease" title="Disease">disease</a>, <a href="/wiki/Major_trauma" title="Major trauma">trauma</a>, or may be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Congenital_disorder" title="Congenital disorder">congenital</a>, include but are not limited to:\n</p>, <p>Accessibility is often abbreviated as the <a href="/wiki/Numeronym" title="Numeronym">numeronym</a> <i><b>a11y</b></i>, where the number 11 refers to the number of letters omitted. This parallels the abbreviations of <a href="/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" title="Internationalization and localization"><i>internationalization</i> and <i>localization</i></a> as <i>i18n</i> and <i>l10n</i> respectively.\n</p>, <p>People wishing to overcome an impairment in order to use a computer comfortably and productively may require a "special needs assessment" by an <a href="/wiki/Assistive_technology" title="Assistive technology">assistive technology</a> consultant (such as an <a href="/wiki/Occupational_therapist" title="Occupational therapist">occupational therapist</a>, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rehabilitation_engineering_technologist" title="Rehabilitation engineering technologist">rehabilitation engineering technologist</a>, or an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Educational_Technologist" title="Educational Technologist">educational technologist</a>) to help them identify and configure appropriate assistive technologies to meet individual needs.  Even those who are unable to leave their own home or who live far from assessment providers may be assessed (and assisted) remotely using <a href="/wiki/Remote_desktop_software" title="Remote desktop software">remote desktop software</a> and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Web_cam" title="Web cam">web cam</a>. For example, the assessor logs on to the client\'s computer via a <a href="/wiki/Broadband" title="Broadband">broadband</a> <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> connection, observes the users computer skills, and then remotely makes accessibility adjustments to the client\'s computer where necessary.\n</p>, <p>The biggest challenge in computer accessibility is to make resources accessible to people with cognitive disabilities - particularly those with poor communication and reading skills. As an example, people with learning disabilities may rely on proprietary symbols and thus identify particular products via the product\'s symbols or icons.  Unfortunately copyright laws can limit icon or symbol release to web-based programs and websites by owners who are unwilling to release them to the public.\n</p>, <p>In these situations, an alternative approach for users who want to access public computer based terminals in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Libraries" title="Libraries">libraries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Automated_teller_machine" title="Automated teller machine">ATMs</a>, and information kiosks is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a <a href="/wiki/Smart_card" title="Smart card">smart card</a>, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etcetera to their particular needs.  The concept is encompassed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_Europ%C3%A9en_de_Normalisation" title="Comit\xc3\xa9 Europ\xc3\xa9en de Normalisation">CEN</a> standard "Identification card systems \xe2\x80\x93 Human-machine interface".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by <a href="/wiki/SNAPI" title="SNAPI">SNAPI</a> and has been successfully incorporated into the Local Authority Smartcards Standards e-Organisation (LASSeO) specifications.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Since computer interfaces often solicit visual input and provide visual feedback, another significant challenge in computer accessibility involves making software usable by people with visual impairments. For individuals with mild to medium vision impairment, it is helpful to use large <a href="/wiki/Typeface" title="Typeface">fonts</a>, high DPI displays, high-contrast themes and <a href="/wiki/Icon_(computing)" title="Icon (computing)">icons</a> supplemented with auditory feedback and screen magnifying software.  In the case of severe vision impairment such as blindness, <a href="/wiki/Screen_reader" title="Screen reader">screen reader</a> software that provides feedback via <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Text_to_speech" title="Text to speech">text to speech</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display" title="Refreshable braille display">refreshable braille display</a> is a necessary accommodation for interaction with a computer.\n</p>, <p>About 8% of people suffer from some form of <a href="/wiki/Color_blindness" title="Color blindness">color-blindness</a>. The main color combinations that might be confused by people with visual deficiency include red/green and blue/green. However, in a well-designed user interface, color will not be the primary way to distinguish between different pieces of information.\n</p>, <p>Some people may not be able to use a conventional <a href="/wiki/Input_device" title="Input device">input device</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Computer_mouse" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Computer_keyboard" title="Computer keyboard">keyboard</a>, therefore, it is important for software functions to be accessible using both devices.  Ideally, software will use a generic input <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/API" title="API">API</a> that permits the use even of highly specialized devices unheard of at the time of software\'s initial development. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Keyboard_shortcuts" title="Keyboard shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mouse_gesture" title="Mouse gesture">mouse gestures</a> are ways to achieve this access, as are more specialized solutions, including on-screen software keyboards and alternate input devices (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Switch_Access" title="Switch Access">switches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joystick" title="Joystick">joysticks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trackball" title="Trackball">trackballs</a>). Users may enable a <a href="/wiki/Bounce_keys" title="Bounce keys">bounce key</a> feature, allowing the keyboard to ignore repeated presses of the same key. <a href="/wiki/Speech_recognition" title="Speech recognition">Speech recognition</a> technology is also a compelling and suitable alternative to conventional keyboard and mouse input as it simply requires a commonly available audio headset.\n</p>, <p>The <a href="/wiki/Astrophysics" title="Astrophysics">astrophysicist</a> <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>\'s use of assistive technology is an example of a person with severe motor and physical limitations who uses technology to support <a href="/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living" title="Activities of daily living">activities of daily living</a>. He used a switch, combined with special software, that allows him to control his <a href="/wiki/Wheelchair" title="Wheelchair">wheelchair</a>-mounted computer using his limited and small movement ability. This personalized system allowed him to remain mobile, do research, produce his written work.  Mr. Hawking also used <a href="/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication" title="Augmentative and alternative communication">augmentative and alternative communication</a> technology to speak and an <a href="/wiki/Environmental_control_device" title="Environmental control device">environmental control device</a> to access equipment independently.\n</p>, <p>A small amount of modern research indicates that utilizing a standard computer mouse device improves fine-motor skills.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>While <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Sound_user_interface&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sound user interface (page does not exist)">sound user interfaces</a> have a secondary role in common desktop computing, these interfaces are usually limited to using <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=System_sound&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="System sound (page does not exist)">system sounds</a> such as feedback.  Some software producers take into account people who can\'t hear due to hearing impairments, <a href="/wiki/Silence" title="Silence">silence</a> requirements or lack of sound producing software.  System sounds like beeps can be substituted or supplemented with visual notifications and captioned text (akin to <a href="/wiki/Closed_captioning" title="Closed captioning">closed captioning</a>). Closed captions are a very popular means of relaying information for the Deaf and hearing impaired communities.\n</p>, <p>Software <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/API" title="API">APIs</a> (application programming interfaces) exist to allow assistive technology products such as <a href="/wiki/Screen_reader" title="Screen reader">screen readers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Screen_magnifier" title="Screen magnifier">screen magnifiers</a> to work with mainstream software. The current or past APIs include:\n</p>, <p>Some of these APIs are being standardized in the <a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=ISO/IEC_13066&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="ISO/IEC 13066 (page does not exist)">ISO/IEC 13066</a> series of standards.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>Accessibility software can also make input devices easier to access at the user level:\n</p>, <p>Other approaches that may be particularly relevant to users with a learning disability include: \n</p>, <p>\nEnabling access to Web content for all users is the concern of the <a href="/wiki/Web_accessibility" title="Web accessibility">Web accessibility</a> movement, which strives to create accessible websites via conformance to certain design principles.  For example, <a href="/wiki/Screen_reader" title="Screen reader">screen readers</a> are of limited use when reading text from websites designed without consideration to accessibility.  Sometimes these limitations are due to the differences between spoken and written language and the complexity of text, but it is often caused by poor page design practices. The tendency to indicate semantic meaning using methods that are purely presentational (e.g. larger or smaller font sizes, using different font colors, embedded images, or <a href="/wiki/Multimedia" title="Multimedia">multimedia</a> to provide information) restricts meaningful access to some users. Therefore, designing sites in accordance with Web accessibility principles helps enable meaningful access for all users.  </p>, <p>The Open Accessibility Framework (OAF)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> provides an outline of the steps that must be in place in order for any <a href="/wiki/Computing_platform" title="Computing platform">computing platform</a> to be considered accessible. These steps are analogous to those necessary to make a physical or built environment accessible. The OAF divides the required steps into two categories: creation and use.\n</p>, <p>The \xe2\x80\x9ccreation\xe2\x80\x9d steps describe the precursors and building blocks required for technology developers to create accessible applications and products. They are as follows:\n</p>, <p>The \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d steps describe what is necessary in the computing environment in which these accessible applications will run.
