If something goes wrong, SCM can determine what was changed and who changed it.

The SCM tools themselves have become virtual appliances that can be instantiated as virtual machines and saved with state and version.  The tools can model and manage cloud-based virtual resources, including virtual appliances, storage units, and software bundles.  The roles and responsibilities of the actors have become merged as well with developers now being able to dynamically instantiate virtual servers and related resources.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>The history of software configuration management (SCM) in computing can be traced back as early as the 1950s, when CM (for Configuration Management), originally for hardware development and production control, was being applied to software development. Early software had a physical footprint, such as <a href="/wiki/Punched_card" title="Punched card">cards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Punched_tape" title="Punched tape">tapes</a>, and other media. The first software configuration management was a manual operation. With the advances in language and complexity, <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering" title="Software engineering">software engineering</a>, involving configuration management and other methods, became a major concern due to issues like schedule, budget, and quality. Practical lessons, over the years, had led to the definition, and establishment, of procedures and tools. Eventually, the tools became systems to manage software changes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Industry-wide practices were offered as solutions, either in an open or proprietary manner (such as <a href="/wiki/Revision_Control_System" title="Revision Control System">Revision Control System</a>). With the growing use of computers, systems emerged that handled a broader scope, including <a href="/wiki/Requirements_management" title="Requirements management">requirements management</a>, design alternatives, quality control, and more; later tools followed the guidelines of organizations, such as the <a href="/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model" title="Capability Maturity Model">Capability Maturity Model</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Software_Engineering_Institute" title="Software Engineering Institute">Software Engineering Institute</a>.\n</p>]
