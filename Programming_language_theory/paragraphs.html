[<p><b>Programming language theory</b> (<b>PLT</b>) is a branch of <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of <a href="/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> and their individual <a href="/wiki/Programming_language#Elements" title="Programming language">features</a>.  It falls within the discipline of <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, both depending on and affecting <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering" title="Software engineering">software engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_science" title="Cognitive science">cognitive science</a>.  It is a well-recognized branch of computer science, and an active research area, with results published in numerous <a href="/wiki/Academic_journal" title="Academic journal">journals</a> dedicated to PLT, as well as in general computer science and engineering publications.\n</p>, <p>In some ways, the history of programming language theory predates even the development of programming languages themselves.  The <a href="/wiki/Lambda_calculus" title="Lambda calculus">lambda calculus</a>, developed by <a href="/wiki/Alonzo_Church" title="Alonzo Church">Alonzo Church</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene" title="Stephen Cole Kleene">Stephen Cole Kleene</a> in the 1930s, is considered by some to be the world\'s first programming language, even though it was intended to <a href="/wiki/Model_of_computation" title="Model of computation"><i>model</i></a> computation rather than being a means for programmers to <a href="/wiki/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming"><i>describe</i></a> algorithms to a computer system.  Many modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Functional_programming_language" title="Functional programming language">functional programming languages</a> have been described as providing a "thin veneer" over the lambda calculus,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and many are easily described in terms of it.\n</p>, <p>The first programming language to be invented was <a href="/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl" title="Plankalk\xc3\xbcl">Plankalk\xc3\xbcl</a>, which was designed by <a href="/wiki/Konrad_Zuse" title="Konrad Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a> in the 1940s, but not publicly known until 1972 (and not implemented until 1998).  The first widely known and successful <a href="/wiki/High-level_programming_language" title="High-level programming language">high-level programming language</a> was <a href="/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a>, developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> researchers led by <a href="/wiki/John_Backus" title="John Backus">John Backus</a>.  The success of FORTRAN led to the formation of a committee of scientists to develop a "universal" computer language; the result of their effort was <a href="/wiki/ALGOL_58" title="ALGOL 58">ALGOL 58</a>.  Separately, <a href="/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)" title="John McCarthy (computer scientist)">John McCarthy</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT" title="MIT">MIT</a> developed the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lisp_programming_language" title="Lisp programming language">Lisp programming language</a> (based on the lambda calculus), the first language with origins in academia to be successful.  With the success of these initial efforts, programming languages became an active topic of research in the 1960s and beyond.\n</p>, <p>Some other key events in the history of programming language theory since then:\n</p>, <p>There are several fields of study which either lie within programming language theory, or which have a profound influence on it; many of these have considerable overlap. In addition, PLT makes use of many other branches of <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Computability_theory" title="Computability theory">computability theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Category_theory" title="Category theory">category theory</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Set_theory" title="Set theory">set theory</a>.\n</p>, <p>Formal semantics is the formal specification of the behaviour of computer programs and programming languages. Three common approaches to describe the semantics or "meaning" of a computer program are <a href="/wiki/Denotational_semantics" title="Denotational semantics">denotational semantics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Operational_semantics" title="Operational semantics">operational semantics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Axiomatic_semantics" title="Axiomatic semantics">axiomatic semantics</a>.\n</p>, <p>Type theory is the study of <a href="/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type systems</a>; which are "a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Many programming languages are distinguished by the characteristics of their type systems.\n</p>, <p>Program analysis is the general problem of examining a program and determining key characteristics (such as the absence of classes of <a href="/wiki/Software_bug" title="Software bug">program errors</a>). Program transformation is the process of transforming a program in one form (language) to another form.\n</p>, <p>Comparative programming language analysis seeks to classify programming languages into different types based on their characteristics; broad categories of programming languages are often known as <a href="/wiki/Programming_paradigm" title="Programming paradigm">programming paradigms</a>.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Metaprogramming" title="Metaprogramming">Metaprogramming</a> is the generation of higher-order programs which, when executed, produce programs (possibly in a different language, or in a subset of the original language) as a result.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Domain-specific_language" title="Domain-specific language">Domain-specific languages</a> are languages constructed to efficiently solve problems of a particular part of domain.\n</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">Compiler</a> theory is the theory of writing <i>compilers</i> (or more generally, <i>translators</i>); programs which translate a program written in one language into another form.  The actions of a compiler are traditionally broken up into <i>syntax analysis</i> (<a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scan" title="wikt:scan">scanning</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parsing" title="Parsing">parsing</a>), <i>semantic analysis</i> (determining what a program should do), <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Compiler_optimization" title="Compiler optimization">optimization</a></i> (improving the performance of a program as indicated by some metric; typically execution speed) and <i><a href="/wiki/Code_generation_(compiler)" title="Code generation (compiler)">code generation</a></i> (generation and output of an equivalent program in some target language; often the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Instruction_set" title="Instruction set">instruction set</a> of a CPU).\n</p>, <p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Run-time_system" title="Run-time system">Runtime systems</a> refers to the development of programming language <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Runtime_environment" title="Runtime environment">runtime environments</a> and their components, including <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)" title="Garbage collection (computer science)">garbage collection</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Foreign_function_interface" title="Foreign function interface">foreign function interfaces</a>.\n</p>, <p>Conferences are the primary venue for presenting research in programming languages.
