In view of this, open-source practitioners are starting to use classification schemes in which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FOSS" title="FOSS">FOSS</a> licenses are grouped (typically based on the existence and obligations imposed by the <a href="/wiki/Copyleft" title="Copyleft">copyleft</a> provision; the strength of the copyleft provision).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-36"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>\n</p>, <p>An important legal milestone for the open source / free software movement was passed in 2008, when the US federal appeals court ruled that <a href="/wiki/Free_software_license" title="Free software license">free software licenses</a> definitely do set legally binding conditions on the use of copyrighted work, and they are therefore enforceable under existing copyright law.
